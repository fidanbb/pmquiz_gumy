Question 1
Hint: The team should ensure that their forecast is based on the parameters that are as close to their project environment as possible. 
Correct Answer: C 
Explanation:
Agile project management approach favors empirical and value-based measurements instead of predictive measurements. Agile measures what the team delivers, not what the 
team predicts it will deliver. Theoretically, the project manager could have provided management with an estimate based on the velocity of the first completed iteration. However, 
since there is another answer choice that could result in a better estimate, such as the one based on several iterations, that answer choice would more accurately address the 
question asked. In order to provide the most accurate forecast, the project manager should use as much actual and observed data from the project as possible. This estimation, 
however, assumes that management allows the team to run several iterations. Since there is no sense of urgency in the scenario, the assumption that the team has time is 
reasonable.
Details for Each Option:
A 
Provide an accurate estimate based on the velocity of the first iteration
Incorrect. With no other information available, providing an estimate based on only one iteration is plausible but not the best course of action. Under the circumstances described 
in the scenario and with the given set of the answer choices, another answer choice better addresses the question asked. Additionally, providing an estimate based on only one 
iteration would likely be inaccurate since the velocity tends to vary from iteration to iteration until it stabilizes
B 
Request time to develop the project schedule baseline
Incorrect. Unless the scenario states otherwise, agile projects do not typically use traditional project management artifacts, such as the schedule baseline.
C
If possible, defer estimating until after a few iterations are completed
Correct. If and when possible, the team should defer estimating until after a few iterations as this should provide a more accurate forecast. The keyword in this answer choice is "if 
possible". If there was a sense of urgency in the scenario, e.g., the management wanted the estimation urgently, deferring the estimation would unlikely be possible.
D
Provide a random date just to calm the management down
Incorrect. It should be evident that the way this answer choice is worded makes it an incorrect answer.

Question 2
Hint: Face-to-face communication is the most efficient way for agile team members to interact with one another.
Correct Answer: B
Explanation:
Colocating the team members would eliminate the need to communicate using email or other non-face-to-face communication methods. When team 
members are remotely located, the chances for problems with communication are greater than among colocated team members. Additionally, non-
colocated teams experience challenges in important day-to-day interactions among the team members and other project stakeholders.
Details for Each Option:
A
Failure to respond to changes in scope
Incorrect. The question does not mention anything about changes that the customer requested, which the team did not implement.
B
Non colocated team members
Correct. Colocating team members would likely remove communication issues and improve communication. Colocation typically leads to higher 
productivity and the team members who are on the same page.
C
Delivering working software in each sprint
Incorrect. Delivering working software is one of the Agile Manifesto principles, "Deliver working software frequently, from a couple of weeks to a couple of 
months, with a preference to the shorter timescale." Properly implementing this principle would unlikely to lead to the customer's dissatisfaction.
D
Demotivated team members
Incorrect. There are no facts in the question that directly provides evidence for lack of motivation.

Question3 
Hint: What process group are you in?
Correct Answer: A 
Explanation:
The question implies the project is in the Close Project or Phase process. It is important to distinguish the difference between formal acceptance of project deliverables in the Validate Scope 
process versus 'confirming formal acceptance in the Close Project or Phase process. When closing a project, it is necessary to confirm the acceptance of all project deliverables in order to 
adequately complete and close the project. By doing this, the project manager is essentially 'confirming the delivery and formal acceptance of deliverables by the client. Sometimes, this can be 
viewed as ticking a checkbox in the checklist of the activities carried out during project closure. It is like asking the question, "Have the deliverables been accepted earlier in the project as part of 
the Validate Scope process?". If the answer is "Yes", check the box. This would eventually confirm that the deliverables have already been accepted.
Details for Each Option:
A Confirm the final acceptance of the deliverable
Correct. Based on the scenario described, the project manager is carrying out the Close Project or Phase process. Although the customer or sponsor formally accepts the completed project 
deliverables in the Validate Scope process, in the Close Project or Phase process, you must confirm final acceptance of the project deliverables.
B Settle procurement claims
Incorrect. When a PMP exam question refers to procurements, it does this from the perspective of a buyer. In this scenario, the buyer is the cilent, and you are the seller. Therefore, setting 
procurement claims is not applicable in this scenario. Theoretically, if the project manager, as a seller, subcontracted part of the work to a vendor, then the project manager would have to settle 
procurement claims as specified in the contract with the vendor. However, there is not enough Information in the question to determine whether or not contracts with vendors have been used in 
the project. Even if the question referred to the procurement claims between the seller and the client as a buyer, these claims would have been settled using the claims administration technique 
as part of the Control Procurements process, which should have been completed before project closure. Based on all the above considerations, settling procurement claims is not the best answer 
to the question asked.
C Validate the scope objectives have been met
Incorrect. The Validate Scope process is the process of formalizing acceptance of the completed project deliverables. This answer choice is incorrect for a couple of reasons. First, the scenario 
states that the client has already formally accepted the work. Secondly, the Validate Scope process is part of the Monitoring and Controlling Process Group and not part of project closure as 
impiled by the scenario.
D Ensure quality assurance was performed
Incorrect. Quality assurance is done as part of the Manage Quality process to examine and correct the process itself. Quality assurance would have been performed before the Close Project or 
Phase process has begun, and therefore is an incorrect answer.

Question 4 
Hint: What action might help maximize the work not done?
Correct Answer: D 
Explanation:
The scenario describes a situation where only some compliance-related policies and procedures for an agile project will be applicable. One of the principles outlined in the Agile Manifesto states, 
"Simplicity - the art of maximizing the amount of work not done - is essential." Compliance activities represent overhead, which does not directly provide value. In keeping with an agile mindset, 
the project manager should minimize the overhead and only include those compliance activities that are necessary. Classifying the compliance categories is one of the tasks associated with the 
Business Environment domain of the Project Management Professional (PMP) Examination Content Outline. Classifying the compliance categories that have been captured in the organization's 
policies and procedures may be helpful in differentiating those that require the expenditure of resources and those that do not. For example, the organization may have specific guidelines for 
complying with union rules and activities. However, if the project underway will not have union involvement, then that entire compliance category can be disregarded.
Details for Each Option:
A
Switch the project management approach from agile to traditional
Incorrect. The selection of a project management framework should be based upon the needs of the project rather than simply compliance activities. Compliance can be effectively addressed by 
any project management framework.
B
Incorporate all compliance policies and procedures in the implementation strategy
Incorrect. According to the scenario, only some of the organization's policies and procedures regarding compliance will be applicable to the project. There is no reason to develop strategies for 
the policies and procedures that do not apply to the project. This action would be inconsistent with the agile principle of maximizing the amount of work not done.
C
Ensure compliance activities are included in the project schedule baseline
Incorrect. A schedule baseline is typically used on projects led by a predictive project management approach, while the scenario describes an agile project.
D
Classify the compliance categories to determine the expenditure of project resources
Correct. Classifying the compliance categories that have been captured in the organization's policies and procedures may be helpful in differentiating those that require the expenditure of 
resources and those that do not.

Question 5 
Hint: Where are problems encountered during a project tracked and monitored?
Correct Answer: D 
Explanation:
The question implies that the project manager was carrying out the Implement Risk Responses process. An issue log is one of the project documents that may be updated during 
that process. The issue log is a project document where all issues are recorded and tracked. Data on issues may include the issue type, who raised the issue and when, description, 
priority, who is assigned to the issue, target resolution date, status, and final resolution. The issue log will help the project manager effectively track and manage issues, ensuring 
that they are investigated and resolved. Therefore, capturing this issue in the issue log is what the project manager should do first.
Details for Each Option:
A
Capture the problem in the issue resolution register
Incorrect. 'Issue resolution register is a fake term made up for this question.
B
Update the communications management plan
Incorrect. The communications management plan is a component of the project management plan that describes how, when, and by whom information about the project will be 
administered and disseminated. It is not clear from the description provided whether or not the communications management plan will need to be updated. However, even if the 
communications management plan needs to be updated, the issue should first be captured in the issue log, and then a change request would need to be submitted and approved 
before the communications management plan can be updated.
C
Submit a change request
Incorrect. There is not enough information provided by the question to determine if a change request is needed to resolve the issue. The issue should first be captured in the issue 
log. The issue will then be assigned for follow up where a determination can be made about the appropriate action to be taken which may or may not include a change request.
D
Record the information in the issue log
Correct. The issue log is a project document where all issues are recorded and tracked. The problem described by the question should be recorded in the issue log along with 
other pertinent information including to whom the issue is assigned. From there the issue should be monitored and tracked to ensure a resolution.

Question 6 
Hint: Only two days are left to accomplish the iteration goal.
Correct Answer: C
Explanation:
Coaching is aimed to help the team members perform at their best, to stay on track, to resolve issues and concerns, to continuously improve their skills. The team members need to know what 
they are doing well and what could they improve. One-on-one meetings set at scheduled intervals are one of the agile coaching practices. However, issues that require immediate attention (the 
iteration goal is in jeopardy risking the whole project) should be addressed by agile leaders in real-time. As part of the on-going coaching efforts, the project manager has to step in, understand 
why the performance of the developer has degraded, and help the developer to resolve the issue. This help should be provided without waiting for the pre-scheduled one-on-one meeting, which 
could be too late in this situation.
As stated by the authors in the reference, "And even these scheduled one-on-ones are not meant to prevent the team's coach from helping the team when he or she sees a clear need. Don't wait 
for a one-on-one if you see an action occurs that needs redirection. Employ real-time feedback and address the issues as they arise; try to provide the feedback as close to the event as possible 
so it is more meaningful and corrections can be made quickly."
Details for Each Option:
A
Conduct the individual performance appraisal of the developer
Incorrect. Self-organizing teams may challenge Internal management policies, and managers may struggle with the individual performance appraisals. On agile projects, Individual team members 
are typically not appraised. Agile promotes a team rather than an Individual performance assessment
B
Ask the team to swarm on the tasks assigned to the developer
Incorrect. Swarming on the tasks assigned to the developer might be a plausible option. However, with only two days left to the end of the iteration, it is reasonable to assume that by completing 
the tasks of the developer, the team members will be unable to complete their own tasks. Therefore, in this situation, swarming is unlikely to be the best course of action.
C
Employ real-time feedback to address the issue with the developer
Correct. With only two days left until the end of the iteration and the whole project, the project manager should do everything in their power to help the team member resolve the issue and 
accomplish the iteration goal. Then, at the one-on-one meeting, after the iteration ends, further action can be considered, including a more in-depth analysis of the situation.
D
Wait for the one-on-one meeting scheduled with the developer
Incorrect. Although one-on-one meetings are one of the agile practices to coach team members, in this situation, waiting until after the Iteration is completed would be too late. Feedback and 
help should be provided in real-time so that the iteration goal could be met

Question 7 
Hint: How might colocation influence the project team's performance?
Correct Answer: C
Explanation:
Project leaders are responsible for creating a collaborative project team environment. Collaboration is particularly vital in an agile environment, described by the question. However, in the 
scenario, the project manager assigned tasks to individual team members, which goes against agile best practices. Agile team members are empowered to decide on how' the work will be 
completed and what tasks each team member will pull from the sprint backlog. The scenario indicates that this was the project manager's first agile project, which explains the approach the 
project manager took while assigning work to the team. As a result, the team members worked on their tasks individually. i.e., in isolation. The likely result of this situation is that issues would 
only be uncovered when the project team members attempt to integrate their completed work.
Project teams that work collaboratively can accomplish a shared goal more effectively and efficiently than individuals working on their own. By having the project team members work 
collaboratively in a war room rather than individually, team members would have been able to align their work in near real-time, which would have likely reduced the amount of rework.
Details for Each Option:
A
Increased the work in progress (WIP) limits on the team's Kanban board
Incorrect. It is not clear from the scenario whether or not a Kanban board was used. Even if we assume that a Kanban board was used, increasing the WIP limits would be counterproductive. WIP 
limits are put in place specifically to reduce the amount of work in progress. The greater the work in progress, the greater the risk of rework.
B
Increased the number of developers on the project team
Incorrect. In the scenario, the project ran over budget. Adding resources could have shortened the project duration but would have Increased project costs even further. Additionally, Increasing 
the size of the project team does not address the problem of excessive rework, which was identified as the reason for the project missing its objectives.
C
Established a war room for the project team to work collaboratively
Correct. Colocation is an agile best practice in which the project team members are all physically co-located in a common area such as a war room or a common area (derived from the 'caves and 
common practice). Project teams that work collaboratively can accomplish a shared goal more effectively and efficiently than Individuals working on their own.
D 
Established a more robust change control process
Incorrect. Agile projects, like the one described in the scenario, do not typically employ a rigorous change control process. Rather, agile projects hamess change for the benefit of the customer 
and are more efficient without the burden of a change control process, let alone making it even more robust (assuming one was established for the project).

Question 8 
Hint: Understanding the specific gap between the quality standard and deliverables is crucial.
Correct Answer: B
Explanation:
The first step in addressing a quality-standard gap is to evaluate how the deliverables measure against the agreed-upon quality requirements. This ensures a focused and informed approach to 
resolving the issue. Escalating (A) or revising schedules (C) may be premature without understanding the gap, and lessons learned (D) would be a retrospective activity.
The logical first step in quality management is to assess and analyze the gap between the project's deliverables and the quality requirements. By conducting this evaluation, the project manager 
can determine the extent of the issue (How far is the website's page load speed from the expected standard?), identify the root cause (Is the issue due to inefficient coding, server response time, 
or lack of proper optimization?), and decide on corrective actions (Will caching, code optimization, or infrastructure improvements help meet the standard?). This approach aligns with quality 
assurance principles from the PMBOK® Guide, which emphasize proactive assessment and gap analysis before taking action.
First step in quality management: Evaluate deliverables against the defined quality standards. Importance of root cause analysis: Before taking action, understand why the deliverable does not 
meet expectations. Decision-making process: Scope, schedule, or escalation changes should be based on a clear assessment rather than assumptions. Corrective actions should be data- driven: 
Any corrective action risks being ineffective without identifying gaps.
Details for Each Option:
A
Escalate the issue to the sponsor to determine next steps.
Incorrect. Escalation should occur only after all efforts to resolve the issue have been explored.
B
Evaluate the quality requirements against project deliverables to identify gaps.
Correct. Evaluating the deliverables against quality requirements helps identify the root cause of the gap.
C
Revise the project schedule to allocate more time for testing.
Incorrect. Revising the schedule without analysis might waste resources or delay other tasks unnecessarily.
D
Conduct a lessons-learned session with the team to address the issue.
Incorrect. Lessons learned sessions are not appropriate for addressing current quality gaps.

Question 9 
Hint: Consider that the requirement needs to be added to a project baseline and that the project manager needs to be fair to all vendors.
Correct Answer: D
Explanation:
According to the scenario, the project manager is performing the Conduct Procurements process. A bidder conference (also called a contractor conference, vendor conference, and a pre-bid 
conference) is one of the tools and techniques used as part of this process. The project manager should be fair to all vendors and abide by the value of faimess in the PMI Code of Ethics and 
Professional Conduct. Project managers should constantly re-examine their impartiality and objectivity, taking corrective action as needed. The project manager, in this scenario, should provide 
equal access to information to those who are authorized to have that information. The missed requirement should also be added to the project scope baseline, which requires the Perform 
Integrated Change Control process to be carried out, including an approved change request.
Note, a procurement SOW can be revised as required as it moves through the procurement process until incorporated into a signed agreement. After that, if the SOW requires an update, an 
approved changed request is needed to modify it as it is part of the agreement. While this point is not covered by the correct answer choice, updating the SOW, submitting a change request to 
update the scope baseline, and communicating the changes to all vendors is still the best answer of those provided.
Details for Each Option:
A
No further action is needed as the vendor's question have been addressed
Incorrect. The project manager's response may give that vendor an unfair advantage in bidding.
B
Update the statement of work and the scope baseline, and communicate the changes to all vendors
Incorrect. The procurement statement of work is the description of the procurement Item based on the scope baseline and should indeed be updated. The changes should be communicated to 
the vendors. The scope baseline is part of the project management plan and is, therefore a controlled document. This answer is incorrect since it skips the change control procedure.
C
Update the statement of work and the scope baseline, and hold another pre-bid conference
Incorrect. Another pre-bid conference is one way to communicate clearly to all vendors in fairness for the procurement process. However, since the scope baseline is part of the project 
management plan, it is a controlled document which cannot be updated without an approved change request. This choice skips the Perform Integrated Change Control process. 
D
Update the SOW, submit a change request to update the scope baseline, and communicate the changes to all vendors
Correct. Changes to the baseline must undergo the Perform Integrated Change Control process. A change to the statement of work should be cleanly communicated to all vendors.

Question 10 
Hint: How might the project management framework differ between drug development phase and the governmental approval process? 
Correct Answer: A 
Explanation:
The scenario describes a project with two very different phases. The drug development phase, being characterized by a high degree of uncertainty, complexity, and risk, is well-
suited to an agile project management framework. Governmental approval is described as a highly structured and well-defined process, which is best suited to a predictive 
approach. It is important to remember that it is not necessary to maintain a single approach throughout the project. In some cases, it can be advantageous to combine different 
life cycles in order to best support the needs of the project. Thus, a hybrid approach using agile for drug development and a predictive framework for the governmental approvals 
provides the best strategy to manage the project.
Details for Each Option:
A
Agile for the drug development phase, and predictive for the governmental approval process
Correct. In this scenario, the drug development phase, which is characterized by a high degree of uncertainty, complexity, and risk is well-suited to an agile project management 
framework. Whereas, the governmental approval process would benefit from a predictive approach.
B 
Predictive for the drug development phase, and agile for the governmental approval process
Incorrect. The scenario indicates that drug development will have a high degree of uncertainty, complexity, and risk. These aspects of the project would be better served with an 
agile approach rather than predictive. Additionally, projects that are highly structured and well defined are better suited to a predictive approach rather than agile.
C 
Kanban to maximize WIP for compliance activities related to the governmental approval process
Incorrect. The project might benefit by incorporating the Kanban method. However, Kanban best practices seek to limit rather than maximize work in progress (WIP).
D 
Crystal clear for both the drug development phase and the governmental approval process
Incorrect. Crystal is a family of methodologies that can be scaled depending on the project size and its criticality. Crystal clear is the lightest weight of the crystal family and is not 
suited for a life-critical project described in the scenario.

Question 11 
Hint: Agile best practices do not supersede organizational policy.
Correct Answer: B
Explanation:
Agile best practices do not supersede organizational policies. The project manager, as a diligent, respectful, and caring steward, has an obligation to comply with all organizational policies, even 
those that the project manager considers redundant. In an agile environment, the product owner serves as the voice of the customer and can ensure that changes are consistent with the overall 
project goals. In this scenario, any member of the change control board (CCB) can approve a change. Under the circumstances described in the scenario, complying with the new policy and, at 
the same time, adding the product owner as a member of the CCB would effectively grant approval authority to the product owner, thus providing a reasonable solution to the problem 
statement. However, if the request to grant the product owner the approval authority is denied, the project manager will need to continue submitting change requests even if it negatively 
impacts the project.
Details for Each Option:
A
Submit the change requests after the changes have been implemented to avoid delays
Incorrect. The purpose of submitting a change request is to obtain approval for the change before it is implemented. Submitting change requests after the fact would violate the intent of the 
organization's new policy and go against the project management principle of being a diligent, respectful, and caring steward.
B
Comply with the new policy but request that the product owner be added as a member of the CCB
Correct. The project manager has an obligation to comply with all organizational policies. In an agile environment, the product owner serves as the voice of the customer and can ensure that 
changes conform with the customer's goals. Granting approval authority to the product owner would be a reasonable solution to the problem.
C 
Use discretion and only submit change requests that impact the project budget
Incorrect. The CCB might or might not be most interested in changes that impact the project budget. However, in this scenario, the organizational policy stipulates that all project changes must be 
approved by at least one member of the CCB. The project manager has to comply with the new policy and submit requests for all changes rather than just a subset.
D 
Adhere to agile best practices and bypass the new change control process
Incorrect. Agile best practices indeed avoid the use of a formal change control process. However, agile best practices do not supersede organizational policies. The project manager, as a diligent 
steward, is obligated to comply with all established policies even when they seem to conflict with agile best practices.

Question 12 
Hint: The project kick-off meeting usually takes place at the end of project planning and the start of executing. The project team and stakeholders attend the meeting.
Correct Answer: A
Explanation:
The scenario implies that the Develop Project Management Plan process is being carried out. The project management plan is the main output of this process. The project kick-off meeting is 
usually associated with the end of planning and the start of executing. However, before project execution may begin, the project management plan has to be approved. The kick-off meeting is 
aimed to communicate the beginning of the project, key milestones, and other relevant information in order to inform and engage stakeholders and gain commitment.
Details for Each Option:
A
Inform and engage stakeholders and gain commitment
Correct. The purpose of a project kick-off meeting is to communicate the objectives of the project, gain commitment of the team for the project, and explain the roles and responsibilities of 
stakeholders.
B 
Manage threats and opportunities throughout the project
Incorrect. Threats and opportunities are collectively known as risks. While the major project risks can be communicated on the kick-off meeting, managing the risks is not a goal of this meeting.
C
Ensure that the project is completed on schedule and budget
Incorrect. Ensuring that the project is completed on schedule and budget is one of main tasks of the project manager. However, this task is ongoing throughout the project life cycle rather than a 
one-time effort presented at the project kick-off meeting.
D 
Secure resources required to complete project deliverables
Incorrect. This response describes the task of developing the resource (and, if needed, procurement) management plan rather than conducting the kick-off meeting.

Question 13
Hint: Which document authorizes the existence of a project and gives the project manager authority?
Correct Answer: B
Explanation:
A project charter is the document that authorizes the existence of a project and provides the project manager with the authority to apply organizational resources to project activities. The project 
charter also states the purpose, primary objectives, vision, and mission for the project, aligning the project stakeholders and the project team with the project goals, expectations, and outcomes. 
A project sponsor approves the project charter and is supposed to provide support for the project manager to achieve the project goals. While other answer choices could have been the source 
of 'some of the project manager's problems, the lack of a project charter addresses all of the project manager's problems and is, therefore, the best answer to the question asked.
Details for Each Option:
A Weak leadership skills
Incorrect. Leadership skills involve the ability to guide, motivate, and direct a team, as well as continuously communicate the project vision to the stakeholders and the team. The scenario 
suggests the stakeholders and the project team have differing opinions about the objectives and the outcome of the project. Although weak leadership skills may have led to that problem, there 
are other issues with project implying that the project manager's weak leadership skills are not the main or the only source of the issues.
BLack of a project charter
Correct. The project charter formally authorizes the existence of a project and would have provided the project manager with the authority to apply organizational resources to project activities. 
A project sponsor approves and signs off the charter and acts as a project champion who supports the project, the project manager, and is concerned with the project's success. Therefore, the 
difficulty the project manager is encountering with decision making and acquiring computer hardware may have been eliminated if there had been a charter. The project charter also states the 
purpose, primary objectives, and vision for the project and would have provided the project team, as well as the stakeholders, with the same understanding of such. An approved project charter 
could have prevented the issues mentioned in the scenario from happening. Therefore, the lack of a project charter is the most likely source of the problems.
C Lack of a project management plan
Incorrect. The project management plan describes how the project will be executed, monitored and controlled, and closed. The problems the project manager is having with the project are 
related to his lack of authority, a lack of project goals, and difficulty getting sponsors to make decisions. These issues represent the lack of a project charter and not the lack of a project 
management plan.
D Lack of a procurement management plan
Incorrect. The procurement management plan describes how a project team will acquire goods and services from outside of the performing organization. the project manager's problem 
obtaining the computer hardware is most likely related to his lack of authority to purchase the equipment, not the lack of a procurement management plan.

Question 14
Hint: To answer this question correctly, think of how agile views servant leadership.
Correct Answer: C
Explanation:
Helping the team to deal with impediments, reminding the team of the importance of time-boxing, and suggesting the team to use information radiators is the best course of action for the 
project manager to take in this situation. Such behavior represents the agile servant leadership approach. The project manager should not enforce the use of any tools or techniques with which 
the team is not comfortable. Rather, the project manager could suggest adapting existing solutions, such as an information radiator, that may better meet the needs of the team and are aligned 
with Agile best practices.
Details for Each Option:
A Help the team deal with impediments, remind of the importance of time-boxing, and force the team to use information radiators
Incorrect. Helping the team remove Impediments and reminding the team of the importance and discipline of time-boxed events is what the project manager is expected to do. However, the 
project manager should not force the team into using Information radiators. First, forcing is not the agile way of managing projects; second, the team may have reasons for using other ways of 
communicating the project status.
B Tell the team to deal with impediments, remind of the importance of time-boxing, and suggest the team to use information radiators
Incorrect. Removing impediments is one of the duties of the project manager as a servant leader. Telling the team to deal with impediments is not aligned with the agile leadership style. Based 
on this alone, the answer choice can be eliminated.
C Help the team deal with impediments, remind of the importance of time-boxing, and suggest the team to use information radiators
Correct. Of the choices provided, this answer represents the best course of action for the project manager to take.
D Do nothing, since the issues are minor and can be handled by the team because agile teams are self-managing and self-organizing
Incorrect. While it is subjective to whether or not the issues described in the question are minor, even minor issues have to be dealt with in order to help the team better apply agile best 
practices and eventually make better progress with their project. Being self-managing and self-organizing does not mean the team always and properly applies the best agile practices.

Question 15
Hint: What are the appropriate topics for a daily standup meeting?
Correct Answer: C
Explanation:
Agile leaders are responsible for creating a collaborative project team environment by establishing the organizational structure, including recurring meetings. A daily standup meeting, also called 
a daily scrum, is a brief meeting during which the team reviews its progress from the previous day, states intentions for the current day, and highlights any impediments. Daily standups are 
typically timeboxed to 15 minutes to keep the team focused on coordinating their efforts for the day. Agile teams are considered self-managing, self-directing, and empowered to make decisions 
concerning their work. Therefore, the word "enforce" in the answer that is considered to be correct may sound too strict for mature agile teams. However, if a project team is getting sidetracked 
with off-topic discussions, the project manager has the responsibility for ensuring that the project follows agile best practices and redirecting the conversation. Under these circumstances, the 
project manager may choose to adopt a directive leadership style and enforce the 15-minute timebox to keep the team members focused on the appropriate topics. Assuming that a discussion 
regarding the implementation of unit testing is necessary, the agile leader can set up a separate meeting for only that topic and ensure that the appropriate stakeholders are in attendance.
Details for Each Option:
A Suggest a compromise for the reasonable amount of unit testing
Incorrect. While brokering a compromise might seem like a plausibly correct response, a lengthy discussion on the implementation of unit testing is not appropriate for a dally standup meeting. 
The agile leader should keep the team focused on an appropriate meeting agenda and intercede when discussions wander off-topic.
B Take no action since agile teams are self-organizing and self-managing
Incorrect. Agile teams are self-managing, and agile leaders should allow the team great latitude with their collaboration efforts. However, the project manager does have an obligation to ensure 
that the project execution is consistent with agile best practices. Spending an hour discussing unit testing at the daily scrum is inconsistent with these practices.
C Going forward, enforce a 15-minute time limit for the daily scrum
Correct. A dally standup meeting, also called a daily scrum, is a timeboxed meeting during which the team reviews its progress from the previous day, states intentions for the current day, and 
highlights any impediments. The project manager is responsible for keeping the team focused on the appropriate topics for the meeting and enforcing the timebox.
D
Ask the product owner to account for unit testing in the project backlog
Incorrect. Unit testing, or any other project-related tasks for that matter, should be accounted for in the product backlog. However, the issue described in the scenario surrounds the length of the 
daily scrum rather than the contents discussed during that meeting. Therefore, Involving the product owner would not address the issue at hand.

Question 16 
Hint: Every project change requires that a formal change control procedure be followed.
Correct Answer: D
Explanation:
Change requests should be processed according to the change management plan, which defines the process for managing changes to the project, including the process for submitting. evaluating 
and implementing change requests. Since one of the answer choices is for the project manager to abide by whatever is in the change management plan, you can eliminate the other answer 
choices since those options may contradict the change management plan. For example, in this scenario, if the change management plan grants authority to the project manager to authorize 
certain types of change requests, then it would be unnecessary for the project manager to go through the change control board for approval. However, to make this determination, the change 
management plan should be consulted. In order to answer this question correctly, one needs to understand that project managers should handle change requests in accordance with the change 
management plan.
Details for Each Option:
A Approve the change request. As the project manager, you should use expert judgment to decide what is best for the project.
Incorrect. Change requests should be processed according to the change management plan. Depending on the change management plan, you, as project manager, may or may not have the 
authority to make the final decision on change requests, regardless of your expertise.
B Meet with the change control board members individually and try to persuade them to approve the change request.
Incorrect. You should follow the process outlined in the change management plan. Assuming that you are not a member of the change control board (CCB) in this scenario, it may be 
Inappropriate for you to circumvent the change control meetings process to try and influence their decision. The CCB should make the ultimate decision as to what, if any, changes are to be made 
to the project based on their expert judgment and the information presented in the actual change request.
C Submit the change request to the change control board and abide by their decision.
Incorrect. You should follow the process outlined in the change management plan. However, since that process was not given in the question, it is possible that the change management plan 
allows you, as project manager, under certain conditions, to make the final decision. Since it cannot be assumed that every change request must go through the change control board, this choice 
is not the best answer of those provided.
D Review the change management plan and follow the established process for processing change requests.
Correct. Change requests should be processed according to the change management plan. Since the correct procedure defined by the change management plan is unknown in this scenario, the 
other answer choices should be eliminated, making this choice the best answer to the question asked.

Question 17
Hint: How do Scrum teams coordinate their activities?
Correct Answer: B
Explanation:
The scenario describes a hybrid project that will use some elements of a predictive approach as indicated by the use of a project schedule in the form of a Gantt chart along with the product 
development teams using the Scrum framework. When a project has two or more Scrum teams with dependencies, the teams will need to coordinate their work. This coordination is typically 
accomplished with regularly scheduled Scrum of Scrum meetings, also known as "meta Scrum". Meta Scrum is a technique in which a representative of each Scrum team attends a meeting with 
the other representative(s) to coordinate their work. Since the project described in the scenario will utilize a project schedule in the form of a Gantt chart, these regularly scheduled and, as 
indicated by the scenario, extended Scrum of Scrum meetings should be reflected in the schedule to account for the time the relevant team members will spend attending these meetings.
Details for Each Option:
A Submit a change request to switch the Gantt chart to burndown chart
Incorrect. First, the scenario indicates that the project is still in planning. Change requests are not required during planning. Second, switching the Gantt chart to the burndown chart makes little 
sense and does not address the essence of the question, which surrounds the coordination between the teams rather than tracking their progress.
B Include Scrum of Scrums (SDS) meetings in the project schedule
Correct. A Scrum of Scrum meeting, also known as "meta Scrum", is a meeting in which two or more Scrum teams coordinate their activities. This technique is necessary if there are 
dependencies between the Scrum teams.
C Crash the schedule to eliminate the dependencies between the teams
Incorrect. Crashing is an example of a schedule compression technique. This technique can be used to shorten the schedule duration rather than eliminate dependencies between activities or 
teams.
D Reflect the actual velocity of the teams in the project schedule
Incorrect. The project schedule will eventually need to be adjusted to reflect the actual velocity of the teams. However, the teams will need to perform at least one sprint in order to calculate 
their actual velocity. The scenario suggests that the project is still in planning; therefore, the teams will not have any performance data with which to calculate their velocity.

Question 18
Hint: A structured and collaborative approach enhances knowledge retention and understanding.
Correct Answer: B
Explanation:
The correct answer is B. A collaborative environment with defined roles ensures that all stakeholders understand their contributions and facilitates effective knowledge transfer.
During knowledge transfer, it is essential to establish a structured and collaborative environment to ensure that the receiving team fully understands the processes, tools, and expectations for an
going operations. Knowledge transfer requires defined roles and responsibilities and active participation from the project and operational teams.
A well-defined communication strategy facilitates practical discussions, documentation, and training sessions. If roles are unclear, there is a risk of incomplete or misunderstood knowledge 
transfer, leading to operational inefficiencies or disruptions.
Details for Each Option:
A Conduct informal meetings with minimal structure to share lessons learned.
Incorrect. Informal meetings may lack structure and fall to capture critical detalls. While Informal meetings can provide valuable insights, they often lack the structure to ensure a comprehensive 
knowledge transfer. Critical Information may be overlooked or lost without defined roles and formal documentation.
B Ensure a collaborative environment with clear communication and defined roles.
Correct. Collaboration and clear roles promote successful knowledge transfer. Establishing a collaborative environment ensures that the project and operational teams are engaged, with clearly 
defined roles and responsibilities. Effective communication enhances knowledge retention, reduces misunderstandings, and supports long-term operational success. 
C Assign only the project sponsor to review the knowledge transfer process.
Incorrect. Involving only the sponsor excludes key contributors. Assigning only the project sponsor to review the knowledge transfer process is ineffective because sponsors typically focus on 
high-level objectives rather than the technical and procedural details necessary for dally operations. Knowledge transfer should involve multiple key stakeholders, including the project team, 
operations staff, and subject matter experts.
D Rely solely on the knowledge management system for transfer without team interaction.
Incorrect. Sole reliance on systems without interaction can result in misinterpretation. While a knowledge management system is valuable, relying solely on it for knowledge transfer is 
Inadequate. Documentation alone cannot replace Interactive discussions, demonstrations, and hands-on training, which are critical for ensuring that the operations team fully understand's the 
transition process.

Question 19 
Hint: An SPI of 0.6 and a CPI of 1.5 mean the project is behind schedule and under budget.
Correct Answer: B
Explanation:
Earned value analysis is used in a project to compare planned versus actual schedule performance and planned versus actual cost performance to decide whether a corrective or preventive 
action is required. A CPI of 1.5 means that the project is getting $1.50 worth of work out of every $1.00 spent. Therefore, the project is under budget, and no corrective or preventive action is 
required. An SPI of 0.6 means that the project is only progressing at 60% of the rate originally planned. Therefore, the project is behind schedule, and corrective action is required. Since the 
project is under budget, there is funding to bring additional team members in or crash the project.
Details for Each Option:
A Nothing. The analysis shows the project is on budget and on schedule.
Incorrect. The analysis given in the scenario says the CPI is 1.5; meaning the project is getting $1.50 worth of work for every $1.00 spent or the project is under budget. The SPI mentioned in the 
scenario is 0.6, meaning the project is only progressing at 60% of the rate planned or the project is behind schedule. The project manager should look for options to correct the schedule. 
Therefore, doing nothing is not the right answer.
B
Consider crashing the project schedule
Correct. Crashing the project schedule is a technique used to shorten the project schedule by adding members to the team. With a CPI of 1.5, the project is under budget; therefore, adding 
additional team members is a viable option for bringing the project schedule back into alignment with the schedule baseline.
C
Replace one of the higher paid team members with a lower-salaried employee
Incorrect. The scenario describes a project that is under budget with a CPI of 1.5, and behind schedule with an SPI of 0.6. Replacing a higher paid team member with a lower salaried one would 
not improve the schedule, which is the problem. Therefore, this is an incorrect answer.
D
Inform the customer that you are extending the delivery date for the project
Incorrect. Earned value analysis is used in a project to compare planned versus actual schedule performance and decide whether a corrective or preventive action is required. The project 
manager cannot arbitrarily adjust the schedule baseline. Therefore, this is not a correct answer.

Question 20 
Hint: Your application upgrade has the opportunity of running faster and with more security. You should find out if your project resources can support it first.
Correct Answer: В
Explanation:
In this question, an unexpected opportunity presents itself. The modification of the application to be upgraded on the new mobile device could have a significant impact on multiple project 
constraints, including project scope, schedule, cost, quality, communications, risk, etc. Therefore, a change request should be submitted and analyzed first before any decision is made. The 
change request will have to go thru the organization's change control process established for the project.
Details for Each Option:
A Create a cost forecast and communicate it to stakeholders
Incorrect. A cost forecast contains either a calculated EAC value or bottom-up EAC value used to inform stakeholders of how much money the project is expected to spend once all activities have 
finished. Although the project stakeholders should be made aware of how much money is likely to be spent by the end of the project, a better answer would have been first to make a decision of 
whether to allocate more funds to capture the opportunity or not. If the funds were approved, a cost forecast may then have been issued to update project stakeholders of the new EAC taken 
from the revised cost baseline. However, that answer choice was not provided. Therefore, creating a forecast is not what you should do next.
B Submit a change request to modify the application
Correct. The question describes an opportunity to modify the application to run faster and more securely. Capturing this opportunity will likely affect multiple project constraints and baselines, so 
a change request should first be submitted and reviewed to understand all of its Impacts. If approved, additional time and money to cover this unplanned work may be added to the cost and 
schedule baselines. While an ideal answer would have been to first conduct a reserve analysis to see how much of a management reserve is available or needed, followed by a change request, 
this option is not provided, Therefore, of the choices given, submitting a change request is the best answer to the question asked.
C Update project funding requirements in consideration for the unexpected work
Incorrect. Project funding requirements are composed of the total funding requirements and periodic funding requirements for the project. A controlled document, project funding requirements 
are derived from the cost baseline and may include the sources of the funding. Although eventually it will be necessary for the project manager to update the project funding requirements in 
consideration for any funds needed to secure the opportunity, this is not the next step that should be taken. A better answer would have been to update the project funding requirements only 
after a change request had been submitted and approved to Incorporate new funds into the cost baseline for the unexpected work, however, that option was not isted.
D Conduct variance analysis for an appropriate reserve amount
Incorrect. This answer choice mixes up variance analysis' with reserve analysis. Reserve analysis is used to determine if previously created reserves are still required or if additional reserves 
should be added. Variance analysis, on the other hand, is the explanation (cause, impact and corrective actions) for any cost (CV = EV-AC), schedule (SV = EV-PV) or variance at completion (VAC = 
BAC-EAC) variances experienced on the project. Although it is important for the project manager to track and monitor any variances encountered on the project, conducting variance analysis is 
not the first step to be taken to capture the opportunity presented. As such, this is not the best answer choice of those provided.

Question 21 
Hint: A project manager needs to take appropriate actions to meet the project's objectives which likely will assist the company in achieving its strategic goals. 
Correct Answer: D
Explanation:
As the project manager, you are ultimately responsible for the project as a whole and its success. You are also the one that has the overall view of the project. The scenario suggests the project 
budget is limiting the project's ability to meet the targeted completion date. While staying within budget is one of your responsibilities, you also need to make integrated decisions and act to 
ensure the project's objectives are met and remain aligned with the business plan and the benefits management plan. By deciding to ask for a budget increase so that the completion date can be 
met, rather than trying to cut costs to stay within the budget, you are contributing toward the project's success. An approved change request will be required to change the project budget.
Details for Each Option:
A Use the contingency reserves
Incorrect. Contingency reserves are allocated for known risks that have been specifically identified during risk analysis. Since the contingency reserves are included in the budget, using them 
would not increase the funding for the project and therefore is not your best course of action.
B Use the management reserves
Incorrect. Management reserves are additional funds to cover unforeseen risks that could impact the project. These reserves are not included in the cost baseline but are part of the approved 
cost budget. An approved change request is required to utilize management reserves and, therefore, cannot be used at the project manager's discretion.
C Cut costs to stay within the budget
Incorrect. The scenario suggests the current budget is a constraint to the project, and that increased funding is required to meet the objectives. While staying within budget is one of your 
responsibilities as the project manager, you also need to make integrated decisions and act to ensure both the project's and the company's objectives are met. By cutting costs to stay within 
budget, the company might miss its strategic goals.
D Ask for a change in the budget
Correct. The scenario suggests you find the budget is a constraint that could hinder the company's realization of one of their strategic goals. By asking for a change in the budget, you Increase the 
chances of the company's to meet its strategic goals.

Question 22 
Hint: How does decentralized purchasing affect your authority?
Correct Answer: B
Explanation:
Decentralized purchasing is found in smaller organizations or startup companies, and those without a purchasing, contracting, or procurement department. In such organizations, 
the project manager may assume the purchasing authority role to negotiate and sign contracts directly. For larger organizations with centralized purchasing, the actual 
procurement and contracting functions may be carried out by a separate department whose role is to purchase, negotiate, and sign contracts. In the scenario described, your 
company has decentralized purchasing. When a supplier offers you discounted goods, you have the authority to complete the purchase. Therefore, the next thing you should do is 
negotiate and sign the contract for the procurement of the discounted supplies.
Details for Each Option:
A Refer the supplier to the project sponsor for procurement
Incorrect. While you may want to discuss the procurement with the project sponsor, in a decentralized purchasing environment, the project manager may assume the authority to 
negotiate and sign contracts directly. Therefore, you would not need to involve the sponsor in the procurement
B Negotiate and sign a procurement contract with the supplier
Correct. Your company uses decentralized purchasing, which means there is not a purchasing, contracting, or procurement department. Therefore, negotiating and signing a 
procurement contract with the supplier would be your best course of action.
C Refer the supplier to the procurement department
Incorrect. A company with decentralized purchasing does not have a procurement department. The project manager has the authority to negotiate and sign purchasing 
agreements directly.
D Refer the supplier to the project management office (PMO)
Incorrect. The PMO can centralize and standardize the management of projects. While PMMOs vary as to what role play in the organization, POS are typically not involved in 
conducting procurements.

Question 23 
Hint: The correct answer is also referred to as a cause-and-effect diagram.
Correct Answer: D 
Explanation:
Quality assurance is the process of translating the quality management plan into executable quality activities that incorporate the organization's quality policies into the project. Data 
representation techniques including the cause-and-effect diagram can be useful during quality assurance. Cause-and-effect diagrams are also known as fishbone diagrams, why-why diagrams, or 
Ishikawa diagrams. This type of diagram breaks down the causes of the problem statement identified into discrete branches, helping to identify the main or root cause of the problem. Of the 
available choices, the cause-and-effect or Ishikawa diagram is the most useful in determining the main cause of a quality issue, making the development of an Ishikawa diagram the best answer 
to the question asked.
Details for Each Option:
A Direct the project team to improve the quality of their work
Incorrect. Directing the project team to improve the quality of their work is not very helpful without first knowing the main cause of the problem. For example, it is possible that the issue les with 
the material and/or equipment rather than the quality of the project team's work. Therefore, this choice is an incorrect response.
B Ask the project sponsor what to do
Incorrect. The project sponsor may very well need to be informed of the quality issues, but it is the project manager's responsibility to determine the cause and implement the necessary action. 
Therefore, this answer choice can be eliminated.
Create an affinity diagram
Incorrect. Affinity diagrams can organize potential causes of defects into groups showing areas that should be focused on the most. However, the question Indicates that the causes of the poor 
quality are not known at this point. Therefore, the project manager should first seek to understand the main cause(s) of the quality issues, making the creation of an affinity diagram an incorrect 
answer.
D Develop an Ishikawa diagram
Correct. Cause-and-effect diagrams are also known as fishbone diagrams, why-why diagrams, or Ishikawa diagrams. This type of diagram breaks down the causes of the problem statement 
identified into discrete branches, helping to identify the main or root cause of the problem. Therefore, of the choices provided, developing an Ishikawa diagram is the best course of action for the 
project manager to take to understand why the product quality does not meet project requirements.

Question 24
Hint: Which technique involves the evaluation of the different choices available to achieve a particular project management objective?
Correct Answer: B 
Explanation: After analyzing several different options to determine which of those options will most help the team meet the objectives of the project, the project manager is selecting a corrective 
action to address his resource needs. This method is an example of alternatives analysis - a technique used in the Control Resources process. The other answer choices are also techniques used 
in the Control Resources process but based on the specific actions being described in this scenario; alternatives analysis emerges as the best choice.
Note, the PMBOK Guide refers to Control Resource as a process concerned with physical resources, while the question describes a scenario with human resources which is typically addressed by 
the Manage Team process. The fact the alteratives analysis technique is associated with the Control Resource process and not the Manage Team process does not mean the technique cannot be 
used in other processes to resolve issues the project manager is facing. In the scenario provided, the discussion the project manager is having with the team members regarding different options 
such as authorizing additional overtime, hiring subcontractors, or bringing in additional resources from another project team within the company is best described by the alternatives analysis 
technique. Therefore, among the available choices, alternatives analysis, while not ideal, is the best answer to the question asked.
Details for Each Option:
A Cost-benefit analysis
Incorrect. This type of analysis focuses on determining the best corrective action in terms of cost, but there is no indication from the question that cost was the major determining factor in the 
decision.
B Alternatives analysis
Correct. Alternatives analysis is a technique of the Control Resources process used to select the best resolution for correcting variances in resource utilization. Alternatives may include paying 
additional for overtime or additional team resources and weighing these alternatives against a late delivery or other factors.
C Problem solving
Incorrect. Problem solving Involves taking methodical steps to deal with a problem. Those steps include: identifying, Investigating, and analyzing the problem; choosing a solution; and checking 
the solution to determine if the problem has been fixed. In the scenario, the project manager is simply discussing various options. Nothing in the scenario indicates that methodical steps to deal 
with a problem have been taken.
D Interpersonal skills
Incorrect. Interpersonal skills, which include negotiation and influencing skills, are not the primary techniques being used in this scenario. The project manager is not negotiating with anyone for 
additional project resources or using influencing to solve the problem. Therefore, this is not the best answer choice.

Question 25 
Hint: What kind of action is most likely a strategy of avoiding the threat entirely, transferring it to a third party, mitigating its likelihood of occurring, actively 
accepting it by putting a reserve in place, and escalating its handling to a higher authority?
Explanation:
Risk avoidance is when the project team acts to eliminate the threat or protect the project from its impact. The avoid strategy, including project 
cancellation, may be adopted when the level of overall project risk is significantly negative.
Transferring the risk involves shifting ownership of a threat to a third party to manage the risk and bear the impact if it occurs. Examples of risk transferring 
include the use of insurance, warranties, guarantees, etc. These actions typically involve payment of a risk premium to the party taking on the threat.
In risk mitigation, the action is taken to reduce the probability and/or impact of a risk - automating processes aims to do just that (assuming some project 
tasks can be done automatically rather than manually).
When a risk is actively accepted, its existence is acknowledged, but no immediate proactive action is taken; instead, a reserve is put in place. Hiring reserve 
workers are an example of risk acceptance.
Lastly, when escalating risk to management, a project team acknowledges that decision-making related to the risk is out of the project team's control and 
beyond their level of authority.

Question 26 
Hint: What action would best ensure the required internal resource is available for the project during or before the initiation stage?
Correct Answer: D 
Explanation:
The question suggests that the project manager is performing the Acquire Resources process. Pre-assignment is one of the tools and techniques that may be used in this process. When physical 
or team resources for a project are determined in advance, they are considered pre-assigned. This situation can occur if the project is the result of specific resources being identified as part of a 
competitive proposal or if the project is dependent upon the expertise of a particular person. Had the qualified agile coach employed by the company been pre-assigned, the resource may have 
been available for the other project and the situation described by the question may have been avoided.
Details for Each Option:
A
Documenting the potential unavailability of the agile coach in the project assumption log
Incorrect. An assumption log is a project document used to record all assumptions and constraints throughout the project life cycle. While documenting the potential unavailability of the agille 
coach in the project assumption log would have ensured that the project stakeholders are aware of the situation, this action alone would not have avoided the situation from occurring In the first 
place.
B
Using different verbiage in the resource management plan to remove the requirement for an agile coach
Incorrect. The resource management plan reflects the contractual requirements, in this case, the use of a qualified agile coach. Changing the verblage of the resource management plan does not 
change the contractual obligation and is not an ethical approach.
C
Assigning a different team member from the company to serve as the agile coach
Incorrect. The question states that the company only employs one Individual with the required skillset to serve as the agile coach, and that resource is not available. Therefore, allowing another 
employee without the contractually required skillset to serve as the agile coach is not a viable option.
D
Securing the internal agile certified practitioner with a pre-assignment when this requirement was first identified.
Correct. When physical or team resources for a project are determined in advance, they are considered pre-assigned. Since the need for an agile certified practitioner would have been Identified 
during the initiation of the project, the Internal agille certified practitioner could have been pre-assigned to meet this requirement in the contract.

Question 27 
Hint: What common agile practice is used to help the team learn, improve, and adapt? 
Correct Answer: A 
Explanation:
The question states the project team is transitioning from a waterfall approach to an agile project management framework. The fact the project still uses some elements of the waterfall to make 
the transition easier implies the project, as a whole, is hybrid. While retrospectives are typically associated with the agile project management framework, they can be used on any project, 
whether it is managed using waterfall/predictive, agile, or hybrid methodology. Retrospectives can be used to investigate issues and provide the project team an opportunity to learn from its 
previous work. Retrospectives allow the team members to improve and adapt their processes. During the iteration retrospective, the project team has the opportunity to discuss the issue of 
duplicate efforts and then adjust their practices to avoid the issue from happening in the upcoming iterations.
Note, the scenario does not specify what duplicate efforts exactly are there on the project. This information, however, is not required to answer the question. The idea is, as always, under the 
circumstances described in this particular scenario and with the given set of the available answer choices, to select the best answer to the question asked. In this case, bringing up the topic 
during the upcoming iteration retrospective is the best answer to the question asked.
Details for Each Option:
A Bring up the topic during the upcoming iteration retrospective
Correct. Regularly scheduled retrospectives can be used on any project, predictive, agile, hybrid. Retrospectives provide the project team an opportunity to leam from its previous work, 
Investigate issues, and improve and adapt their processes.
B Do nothing since the team members are transitioning from waterfall to agile
Incorrect. Project managers are responsible to do everything in their power to make the projects they are leading successful. Duplication of efforts may lead to a waste of project resources thus 
reducing the chances of the project's success. Therefore, doing nothing is unlikely to be the correct answer.
C Fallback to a waterfall project management framework going forward
Incorrect. It is unclear if switching to a waterfall project management framework would resolve the issue of duplicate work. Regardless, this is an extreme response to a relatively minor Issue. The 
project manager should not overreact and revert back to using a waterfall approach, but rather address the issue from within the agille or hybrid framework.
D Submit a change request to update the communications management plan
Incorrect. Change requests may be used when employing a hybrid project management framework implied by the question. However, even if the project used the change control system in place 
to manage changes, it is unclear as to what update exactly to the communications management plan would have been required so that it would have resolved the issue of duplicate efforts.

Question 28 
Hint: Your choice of the most appropriate conflict resolution method can be influenced by factors present at the time of the conflict.
Correct Answer: D
Explanation:
Your success in managing a project and your team often depends on your ability to resolve conflict appropriately and promptly. You should choose the most appropriate conflict resolution 
method based on factors such as the importance and intensity of the conflict and timelines. According to the scenario, the subject of the conflict (a report format) is not critical to project success. 
The project, however, has a critical time constraint and cannot afford any delays. Therefore, you need to address the dispute quickly so that the team members can return to work without further 
delay. The quickest way to resolve the conflict in this situation, and, therefore, your best course of action, is to use the force/direct method by selecting an approach that you think is the best and 
making the decision. Note that the collaborative or problem-solving approach, which incorporates multiple viewpoints and insights from different perspectives, is ideal for resolving conflicts. 
However, such an approach is not always possible. Project managers should use their interpersonal and team skills and situational judgment to determine how best to handle a conflict.
Details for Each Option:
A Tell the team members to figure it out for themselves
Incorrect. Telling the team members to figure it out for themselves is an example of the withdraw avoid technique where you retreat from the situation allowing it to be fixed later or by others. 
This method would take time that you cannot afford. Therefore, this approach is not the best way to resolve the conflict.
B Look for an approach that would completely satisfy both team members
Incorrect. Looking for a resolution to the conflict that would completely satisfy both parties is an example of the collaborate/problem-solving technique, which leads to a win-win solution. Under 
the circumstances provided in the scenario, in which the argument turns into a shouting match, reaching a win-win solution is unlikely realistic given the short timeline and the Intensity of the 
conflict.
C Request that the team members return to work to avoid any further delays
Incorrect. Since the project has a critical time constraint and cannot afford any delays, requesting that the team members return to work may be a plausible option. However, this approach may 
harm the project manager's reputation and is not consistent with the best practices of being a servant leader for the project team.
D Select the report format that you think is best and make the decision
Correct. Pushing one team members viewpoint at the expense of another's is an example of the force/direct technique of conflict resolution. Although this method often results in a win- lose 
situation, this choice is best so you can quickly stop the Intense argument and enable the team members to return to work without further delay.

Question 29 
Hint: What approach is best suited for a project to be optimized for speed of delivery?
Correct Answer: A 
Explanation:
Project leaders need to tailor projects based on context. Some projects need to be optimized for speed of delivery, as requested by the customer in the scenario described. In this case, each 
module represents a subset of the total solution. Since each module can be developed and shipped independently, the customer can derive value as soon as the first module is released. Further 
value can be derived with each subsequent release. To achieve these benefits, the project development approach can be tailored accordingly. For example, incremental life cycles are best suited 
for projects where speed of delivery is the main focus, such as the case depicted in the question. Hence, of the available choices, utilizing an incremental project life cycle with multiple deliveries 
would be the best strategy for the project manager to employ.
Details for Each Option:
A  Utilize an incremental project life cycle with multiple deliveries
Correct. An incremental approach can be beneficial when the project needs to be optimized for the speed of delivery. In this case, each module would represent an increment of the total solution 
and can be released once it has been completed, allowing the customer to begin receiving value as soon as possible.
B  Employ a predictive approach with a single-phase project
Incorrect. When using a predictive approach, the entire project is typically planned upfront, and the completed product is released in a single delivery at the end of the project. A phased 
approach would be a viable option where each module represents a separate phase, but a single-phase project would not support multiple deliveries.
C  Select a hybrid approach and release all modules in a single delivery
Incorrect. A hybrid approach might be an option for this project. However, the customer is focused on the speed of delivery, and each module can be released individually. It would be better to 
release each module once it is complete rather than releasing all of the modules in a single delivery.
D  Outsource the development of each module to a different vendor
Incorrect. Outsourcing the development of each module to a different vendor may or may not result in the fastest delivery. Having multiple vendors introduces other issues and may slow down 
rather than speed up the delivery. Hence, this course of action would not necessarily result in the desired outcome as requested by the customer.

Question 30
Hint: Hint: The answer is part of a phase of the Tuckman Development Ladder.
Correct Answer: C
Explanation:
Before a conflict resolution meeting, the project manager would want to understand and assess any root causes of conflict or lack of communication. Conflict resolution meetings would be 
something to consider in another step in the process.
Suggesting a more integrated approach to creating a scalable and cost-effective setup is a logical step in resolving technical conflicts within a project team. Jumping straight to suggesting 
technical solutions without addressing the underlying interpersonal issues and conflicts can result in superficial resolutions that do not address the root causes of the discord.
Before exploring specific conflict resolution strategies, it is crucial to establish a foundation of shared purpose and mutual respect. By highlighting the importance of collaboration and shared 
goals, the PM creates a supportive atmosphere conducive to more effective conflict resolution later. This foundation helps ensure that subsequent conflict resolution efforts are viewed as 
achieving common objectives.
Regular updates and coordination meetings are more effective in maintaining alignment and ensuring communication when the team functions cohesively. Simply proposing regular meetings 
may address symptoms rather than the underlying issues, leading to inadequate engagement rather than meaningful resolution.
Details for Each Option:
A Organize a conflict resolution meeting encouraging each team member to discuss concerns and listen to each other's viewpoints.
Incorrect. Directly addressing conflicts without setting a positive, collaborative tone can sometimes exacerbate tensions. Team members might not be ready to engage constructively if they are 
still committed to their positions. They need to see the value of collaboration and shared goals before they can effectively resolve conflicts.
B Suggest a more integrated approach to create a scalable, cost-effective setup.
Incorrect. Team members are often more focused on asserting their ideas and perspectives than collaborating. Introducing an integrated approach right away might not get the necessary buy-in 
from all team members, as they might still be reluctant to compromise. Building consensus and collaboration is essential to ensure everyone agrees with the proposed approach. 
C Address the team, stressing the importance of collaboration and reminding them of their common goal.
Correct. During the Storming phase of team development, the first things the P should address with the team are establishing a unified vision of goals, promoting collaboration, creating a positive 
team environment, aligning team efforts, and building trust.
D Propose regular updates and coordinate meetings, ensuring all team members are kept in the loop.
Incorrect. Proposing regular updates and coordination meetings addresses the logistical aspects of project management but does not directly tackle the interpersonal and collaborative 
challenges. Without resolving these human dynamics, the logistical measures may fall flat, as the team's underlying issues remain unaddressed.

Question 31 
Hint: The instant messaging application is a mandatory communication tool.
Correct Answer: C 
Explanation:
The scenario describes the use of a proprietary instant messaging application that, according to your organization, is a mandatory tool to be used for communications under certain 
circumstances, for example, when the employees perform project work in a noisy remate environment. While the use of the instant messaging application on the mobile phones may lead you to 
think the question is talking about communication technology, communication models, or communication methods, the word 'mandatory' should trigger the thought of enterprise environmental 
factors. Any condition, not under the immediate control of the team that influences, constraints, or directs the project, is an enterprise environmental factor (EEF). Established communication 
channels, tools, and systems are an example of the EEF. Since the instant messaging application is defined as 'mandatory' by your organization, meaning it is outside the project team's control, 
the requirement to install the application qualifies as an EEF, in particular as an established communication tool. Therefore, of the choices provided, enterprise environmental factors are the best 
answer to the question asked.
Details for Each Option:
A Pull communication
Incorrect. Pull communication is a type of communication method that requires recipients to access the content at their discretion. This method is typically used for large audiences or complex 
data sets. The requirement to Install the application described in the scenario does not represent a pull communication method.
B Push communication
Incorrect. Push communication is a type of communication method where Information is distributed to specific recipients. This method ensures the information is sent but does not guarantee 
the information was received or understood by the recipient. The requirement to install the application and a communication method are not the same.
C Enterprise environmental factors
Correct. The scenario implies you are carrying out the Plan Communications Management process. Enterprise environmental factors are input to that process. Enterprise environmental factors 
are conditions, not under the immediate control of the team, that Influence, constrain, or direct the project. The scenario describes an instant messaging application that is mandated by your 
organization to be used for communication. Mandatory means the application is not under the Immediate control of the team, making the requirement to install the application an enterprise 
environmental factor.
D Communication model
Incorrect. Communication models represent the communication process in general, rather than a specific communication application or the requirement to install it, as described in the
scenario.

Question 32 
Hint: How are project tasks assigned in agile versus waterfall methodologies?
Correct Answer: D
Explanation:
Every project team needs to clearly define how they will work together, which serves as the basis for their social contract. These team ground rules should be agreed upon and then documented 
in the form of a team charter. The rules can be revised as needed throughout the project. According to the scenario, the project will combine agile and waterfall methodologies, making the 
overall project management approach hybrid. When transitioning from agile to waterfall, the team's working agreements may need to be revised to reflect the differences in how the team 
members will interact. Agile teams are self-organizing and self-managing. Therefore, when parts of a project are executed with an agile methodology (as is the case with the development phase 
of this project), the entire team bears collective product ownership. However, when using a waterfall framework (as is the case with the rollout phase), the project manager is more likely to 
assign tasks to specific individuals, making them individually accountable for completing their assigned tasks. Therefore, the team charter should reflect these changes in group vs. individual 
ownership of the project deliverables as the team transitions from agile to waterfall.
Details for Each Option:
A The team charter will need to be updated to reflect collective ownership for the completion of project tasks.
Incorrect. With agile methodologies, the entire project team bears collective ownership over the project's deliverables. In this scenario, the project is transitioning from agile to waterfall 
Therefore, it is more likely that the project's tasks will be assigned to specific individuals rather than collectively owned by the team.
B The project manager should institute a set of working agreements that worked well on previous waterfall projects.
Incorrect. A set of working agreements from past waterfall projects might be useful as a template for the team to create their own team charter. However, the team will need to customize the 
charter to suit their unique situation. The project manager might provide guidance for the charter, but should not dictate the team's working agreements.
C Each project team member will need to develop their own social contract to support the new framework.
Incorrect. Having each team member develop their own social contract would not be very helpful as the team needs a common set of values rather than individual values. The project team 
members need to develop a set of working agreements at the team level that everyone can support.
D The social contract should reflect a transition from collective to individual ownership for the project tasks.
Correct. When using an agile framework, the project team has collective ownership of the project's deliverables. With a waterfall model, project tasks are more likely to be assigned to specific 
individuals, and they will be accountable for completing their individual assignments.

Question 33 
Hint: Which of the tools in the list are valid data analysis tools for monitoring & controlling project work, and what exactly is analyzed when using each of 
them?
Explanation:
While alternatives analysis selects a corrective action or a combination of corrective and preventive actions to implement, cost-benefit analysis determines 
the best corrective action when it comes to cost factors in a project that deviates from the plan. With earned value analysis, project managers will have a 
more integrated perspective on scope, schedule, and cost performance. Root cause analysis helps identify the main cause or causes of a problem; with 
trend analysis, future performance can be forecasted based on past results. The differences between planned and actual performance are reviewed with 
variance analysis. In contrast, business analysis is not a technique that typically used as part of the Monitor and Control Project Work process implied by 
the scenario.

Question 34 
Hint: What does a resource breakdown structure visualize, and which categories does it typically contain?
Explanation:
The scenario suggests that the project employs a hybrid project management approach. This means that the project manager and team will likely use a 
combination of agile as well as traditional tools and techniques while planning, executing, monitoring, controlling, and closing the project. A resource 
breakdown structure is a project document that is created as one of the outputs of the Estimate Activity Resources process implied by the scenario. This 
document can be graphically displayed as a hierarchical representation of resources by category and type and can help in project resource planning by 
providing a structured view of project resources.
A common way to decompose staff (personnel) entries in the resource breakdown structure is to categorize them according to their level of skills or 
authority. With level 1 indicating a project stakeholder in a leading role, such as the product owner, who is likely to be mapped to the "Personnel (level 1)" 
category. A team member best fits the "Personnel (level 2)" category, and so on. A data server best matches the equipment category, and the team space 
room reasonably falls under facilities. The remaining digital scrum board can be logically mapped as software.

Question 35 
Hint: How might changes be allowed to be made to the adaptive scope without impacting the overall contract?
Correct Answer: D
Explanation:
Larger projects may use an adaptive approach for some deliverables and a traditional project management approach for other parts. In these cases, a governing agreement such as a master 
services agreement (MSA) may be used for the overall engagement, with the adaptive work being placed in an appendix or supplement. This hybrid strategy allows changes to occur on the 
adaptive scope without impacting the overall contract. The incorrect answer choices represent actions that will not permit the selected vendor from using the best project management approach 
for each aspect of the project. Since both vendors are capable of delivering both the hardware and the software, and since there is not enough information in the question to determine which 
one of them is better at delivering projects using the waterfall or agile project management approach, among the available choices, utilizing a master services agreement (MSA) with either of the 
vendors provides the best answer to the question asked.
Details for Each Option:
A Contract with vendor X for hardware, with vendor Y for software and use the appropriate methodology for each
Incorrect. This approach represents a course of action that resolves the issue of which project management methodology to use. However, since both vendors are equally capable of producing 
both the hardware and the software, it is better to make appropriate arrangements to allow one vendor to deliver both. It may save project resources in managing one vendor Instead of two.
B Contract with vendor X for bath hardware and software and require an agile framework for the entire project
Incorrect. As stated by the scenario, it has been concluded that an agile framework is best for developing the software component of the project, but not the hardware. Limiting the vendor to use 
one approach over another would diminish the benefits of using the best project management approach for each aspect of the project
C Contract with vendor Y for bath hardware and software and require a waterfall approach for the entire project
Incorrect. According to the question text, a traditional waterfall project management approach is best to develop the hardware for the project in this case, but not the software component. 
Limiting the vendor to use one approach over another would diminish the benefits of using the best project management approach for each aspect of the project.
D Contract with either vendor X or vendor Y for both hardware and software and utilize a master services agreement
Correct. In this case, a governing agreement such as a master services agreement (MSA) may be used with any of the vendors described in the scenario for the overall engagement, with the 
adaptive work being placed in an appendix or supplement.

Question 36 
Hint: At the Shu level, the project team has little, if any, experience with the Scrum framework.
Correct Answer: D 
Explanation:
The scenario states that the project team is at the Shu level of the Shu-Ha-Ri model with respect to the Scrum framework. The Shu-Ha-Ri model describes the progression of skills acquisition by 
an individual or group. The Shu level indicates, in this case, that the project team lacks proficiency with the Scrum framework, and they should follow the rules as set forth in Scrum. Once the 
project team has acquired sufficient expertise with the Scrum framework, they can progress beyond the Shu level and begin to customize the approach to better suit the needs of the project and 
project team. Therefore, of the available choices, the best approach for the project manager is to follow the scrum ceremonies as close as possible.
Note, the way the scenario is worded implies that the project at its higher level is managed using predictive/traditional methods, while the team is using (or will use) Scrum to develop the 
product of the project. This means the project as a whole is carried out using a hybrid project management approach.
Details for Each Option:
A Request project termination
Incorrect. Terminating the project is an overreaction. The Shu level of the Shu-Ha-RI model indicates that the project team has little knowledge of the Scrum framework. Providing training to the 
team and/or following an established method is a better approach than terminating the project.
B Modify Scrum to fit the project needs
Incorrect. Once an Individual or team has progressed to the Ha level of the Shu-Ha-Ri model, it is appropriate to begin to consciously move away from the rules and begin talloring the approach. 
However, the question states that the team is still at the Shu level, meaning that they should follow the rules until their Scrum skills have progressed.
C Develop a new agile method
Incorrect. Developing a new agile method would imply that the project team has reached the RI level of the Shu-He-Ri model. However, the question states that the project team is still at the Shu 
level. Thus, the project team is not likely to possess the necessary skill set to develop a new agile approach that will better meet project needs.
D Closely follow Scrum ceremonies
Correct. The Shu level of the Shu-Ha-Ri model, as it pertains to this scenario, Indicates that the project team has little, if any, knowledge of the Scrum framework. At the Shu level, the Individual 
or team should follow the Scrum guidelines as close as possible.

Question 37 
Hint: Which data gathering technique is best to elicit confidential information?
Correct Answer: A
Explanation:
The question suggests that the project manager is performing the Collect Requirements process, which is the process of determining, documenting, and managing stakeholder needs and 
requirements to meet project objectives. In support of this process, the project manager will need to employ data gathering techniques to elicit feedback from the stakeholders to determine 
their needs and requirements. The question suggests that the project manager needs to use a data gathering technique where the responses will remain confidential. An interview is a formal or 
informal approach to elicit information from stakeholders by talking to them directly. Of the available choices, conducting interviews is the best tool for the project manager to use to obtain 
confidential information.
Details for Each Option:
A Conduct interviews to elicit information from stakeholders by talking to them directly
Correct. An Interview is a formal or informal approach to elicit information from stakeholders by talking to them directly. Interviews can be useful for obtaining confidential information. Use 
brainstorming to generate and collect multiple ideas related to project requirements
B Incorrect. Brainstorming can be used during the Collect Requirements process to generate and collect multiple ideas related to project requirements. Brainstorming is conducted in a group 
setting; therefore, based on the sensitive nature of the project described in the scenario, the project manager will not likely gather candid feedback from the stakeholders in this situation.
C Hold a focus group to learn about stakeholder expectations and attitudes about the project
Incorrect. A focus group can be used to learn about stakeholder expectations and attitudes about a project. However, a focus group is conducted in a group setting which does not maintain the 
confidentiality of participant responses. Therefore, this is not the best answer choice of the available options.
D Use multicriteria decision analysis to provide a systematic analytical approach for establishing criteria
Incorrect. Multicriteria decision analysis is a decision-making technique that utilizes a decision matrix to provide a systematic analytical approach for establishing criteria, such as risk levels, 
uncertainty, and valuation, to evaluate and rank many ideas. Multicriteria decision analysis is not a data gathering technique and, therefore, is not a method of gathering requirements from 
stakeholders.

Question 38 
Hint: There are five general techniques for resolving conflict withdrawal/avoiding, smoothing/accommodating, compromising/reconciling, forcing/directing, collaborating/problem-solving.
Correct Answer: B
Explanation: Conflict is inevitable on any project. Therefore, conflict management is one of the most important interpersonal and team skills that project managers have to master. The success of 
project managers in managing their project teams often depends on their ability to resolve conflict. In the scenario described, the conflict is between the project manager and the team. The 
conflict is at the level that negatively impacts the team's morale and jeopardizes the project's goals. However, selecting the appropriate conflict resolution technique depends on the project 
manager and the circumstances surrounding the conflict. Under different circumstances, different project managers may use different conflict resolution methods. Factors that influence these 
methods include the importance and intensity of the conflict, time pressure for resolving the conflict, relative power of the people involved in the conflict, importance of maintaining a good 
relationship, motivation to resolve conflict on a long-term or short-term basis, etc.
There are five general techniques for resolving conflict: withdrawal/avoiding, smoothing/accommodating, compromising/reconciling, forcing/directing, collaborating/problem-solving. In the 
scenario, the project manager decides to solve the conflict. There is not enough information in the scenario to determine whether the project manager's decision was right or wrong. However, 
this information is not required to answer the question correctly. All that is needed to select the correct answer is to understand the various degrees of desire to satisfy the concerns of the 
parties involved in the conflict and map the desire to the technique described in the scenario, keeping in mind that the scenario is presented from the project manager's perspective.
Details for Each Option:
A Incorrect. Area A represents a low desire to satisfy team members' concerns but a high desire to satisfy the project manager's own concerns. From the project manager's perspective, this 
would be a force/direct technique, in which the project manager would push his/her viewpoint at the expense of the team, offering a win-lose solution. In the scenario described, the project 
manager decides to solve the conflict, making this an incorrect choice.
B Correct. Area B represents a high desire to satisfy team members' concerns as well as a high desire to satisfy the project manager's own concerns. From the project manager's perspective, this 
would be a collaborate/problem-solve technique, in which multiple viewpoints and insights from different perspectives are incorporated. This approach typically results in a win-win situation. In 
the scenario described, the project manager decides to solve the conflict, making this choice the best answer to the question asked.
D Incorrect. Area C represents a low desire to satisfy team members' concerns as well as a low desire to satisfy the project manager's own concerns. From the project manager's perspective, this 
would be an avoid/withdraw technique, in which parties retreat from an actual or potential conflict situation, postponing the issue to be better prepared or to be resolved by others. In the 
scenario described, the project manager decides to solve the conflict, making this choice an incorrect answer.
D Incorrect. Area D represents a high desire to satisfy team members' concems but a low desire to satisfy the project manager's own concerns. From the project manager's perspective, this 
would be a smooth/accommodate technique in which one party concedes its position to the need of the other party to maintain harmony and relationships. In the scenario described, the project 
manager decides to solve the conflict, making this choice an incorrect answer.
E Incorrect. Area E represents a moderate desire to satisfy team members' concerns as well as a moderate desire to satisfy the project manager's own concerns. From the project manager's 
perspective, this would be a compromise/reconcile technique, in which parties search for solutions that bring some degree of satisfaction to all those involved in the conflict. Since each party 
moderately yields to the other side, this technique only temporarily or partially resolves the conflict and often results in a lose-lose situation. In the scenario described, the project manager 
decides to solve the conflict, making this choice an incorrect answer.

Question 39 
Hint: What serves as an index that measures the willingness of customers to recommend a product or service to others?
Correct Answer: A 
Explanation:
For the project to be successful and deliver the desired outcomes, project leaders must effectively engage with stakeholders, including customers and end-users. A net promoter score (NPS®) is 
an index that measures the willingness of customers to recommend a product or service to others. The score can also be used as a proxy for gauging the customer's overall satisfaction with the 
company's product or service and the customer's loyalty to the brand. Typically customers will be surveyed and asked how likely, on a scale from one to ten, they are to recommend a product or 
service to their family and friends. Scores of nine and ten are considered "promoters", scores of seven and eight are considered "passives", and scores of six or below are considered "detractors". 
A formula is then applied to all of the individual scores to determine the overall NPS®. In the scenario described, a beta version of the app is released to the market, and the project leader wants 
to measure overall satisfaction with the product and gauge the customer's loyalty to the brand. Therefore, of the choices provided, determining the net promoter score (NPS®) would be the best 
course of action for the project leader.
Details for Each Option:
A Determine the net promoter score (NPS®)
Correct. A net promoter score (NPS®) is an index that measures the willingness of customers to recommend a product or service to others. The score is often used as a proxy for gauging the 
customer's overall satisfaction with a company's product or service and the customer's loyalty to the brand, making this choice the best answer to the question asked.
B Develop a prioritization schema
Incorrect. Prioritization schema refers to methods used to prioritize portfolio, program, or project components, as well as requirements, risks, features, or other product information.  
Prioritization schema might be used during product development but would not be helpful in determining customer satisfaction with a released product.
C Apply the Wideband Delphi technique
Incorrect. The Wideband Delphi technique is a consensus-based estimating method that is used to determine the level of effort involved. For example, Wideband Delphi might be used during a 
sprint planning session to assign story points to user stories in the backlog. However, this technique is not typically applied to customer satisfaction.
D Utilize impact mapping
Incorrect. Impact mapping is a strategic planning method that serves as a visual roadmap for the organization. Impact mapping is typically used during product development. Since the scenario 
describes a beta version of a product already released to the customer, utilizing impact mapping would not make sense.

Question 40 
Hint: Agile teams are encouraged to be self-managing.
Correct Answer: A 
Explanation:
Demonstrating leadership behaviors is one of the core project management principles. Delegating authority when appropriate is an example of what a successful leader can do to empower the 
project team and achieve project goals. The scenario suggests that the project is utilizing an agile framework. Agile teams are encouraged to be self-managing, self-directing, and empowered to 
make decisions concerning the way they carry out their work. For example, the determination of how the work will be accomplished and by whom is made by the project team members without 
the need to involve heavy processes or bureaucratic procedures. However, it's the project manager's duty as a servant leader to listen to the stakeholder's suggestion and facilitate a discussion on 
the topic with the team while, at the same time, allowing the team to make the final decision as to whether to adopt the new approach or keep using the current one.
Details for Each Option:
A Review the suggestion with the team and allow them to determine the best approach
Correct. Successful agile teams are self-managing, self-directing, and empowered to make decisions concerning their work. As such, determining the best approach for how to carry out their 
work is made by the team members. The project manager might help facilitate a discussion on the topic, but it's up to the team to make the final decision.
B  Ask the stakeholder to submit a change request to update the schedule baseline
Incorrect. In predictive projects, a change that affects any of the baselines (even if the change may improve the project schedule, as suggested by the scenario) would require an approved change 
request. An agile project, like the one described in the scenario, uses lighter processes and would not require a change request to make modifications.
C  Reject the suggestion to ensure the team is shielded from stakeholder interruptions
Incorrect. Shielding the team from distractions is one of the project manager’s responsibilities as a servant leader. However, this leadership behavior should not be taken to the extreme. Not all 
interruptions are harmful. Balancing the needs of the project, team, and stakeholders is a better approach. Rejecting the suggestion, especially if it can improve project performance, would be an 
overreaction.
D  Use the daily standup meeting as a venue to discuss the suggested change
Incorrect. Discussing the suggested change with the team is the right approach. However, using the daily standup meeting as a venue for this discussion is inappropriate. The daily standup is a 
timeboxed agile event focused on three specific agenda items. Improvement suggestions are not part of them and are better to be discussed at retrospectives.

Question 41 
Hint: Hint: An incremental approach might let the customer take a portion of the project to market early.
Correct Answer: D
Explanation: Agile principles advocate for involving customers throughout the development process to ensure that the product meets their needs and expectations. By withholding the product 
until all features are fully developed, the team denies customers the chance to provide input early on, potentially leading to misalignment between the product and customer needs.
Releasing a product with a mix of features necessary for initial user validation might hinder the Agile principle of leveraging feedback to see a finished piece of the work. It may also risk errors 
between user expectations and product development efforts.
The agile methodology emphasizes iterative development, where the product evolves through continuous feedback and adaptation. By focusing solely on delivering all planned features upfront, 
the team misses out on opportunities to incorporate user feedback into the development process. This approach restricts the team's ability to iterate on the product based on real-world usage 
and evolving user needs.
The agile methodology advocates for iterative development, where the product evolves through incremental releases based on feedback. Delivering a single feature allows the team to focus on a 
specific aspect of the product, ensuring that it's well-designed, functional, and aligned with user needs before moving on to additional features. The final iterative approach enables continuous 
improvement and ensures that the final product meets the customer's expectations. This approach might also allow the customer to take a portion or all of the product to the marketplace 
sooner.
Details for Each Option:
A  Delay the product launch until all the known and unknown feature requirements are understood, then share that with the customer.
Incorrect. Waiting to launch the product until all known and unknown feature requirements are understood prolongs the time to market. Agile principles prioritize delivering value to customers 
quickly and adapting to changing requirements and market conditions. Delaying the launch, the team misses opportunities to capture market share, respond to competitors, and generate 
revenue.
B  Release a product with a mix of several features necessary for the initial user validation.
Incorrect. Releasing a product with a mix of several features Increases the risk of scope creep, where additional features may be added beyond what is necessary for initial user validation. Agile 
methodology emphasizes delivering the minimum features required to provide value to customers and validate assumptions. Introducing too many features upfront may lead to unnecessary 
complexity and delay in delivering a functional product.
C  Focus solely on delivering all planned features without considering user feedback.
Incorrect. Prioritizing the delivery of all planned features without considering user feedback Increases the risk of over-engineering the product. Suppose the team does not validate the needs or 
relevance of each feature through user feedback. In that case, it is more likely to Invest time and resources in developing features that may not effectively contribute to the product's value 
proposition or address user needs. This can result in unnecessary complexity and wasted effort.
D  Let the tearn provide the customer with a feature that might help with any needed changes before delivering the final product.
Correct. The agile methodology of the Animum Viable Product (MVP) emphasizes getting customer feedback and delivering value to customers quickly and iteratively. Providing the customer 
with a single feature allows the team to expedite the delivery process and get a product into the hands of users sooner. This speed of market is essential for gaining a competitive advantage and 
capturing market share, as customers can start benefiting from the product's value proposition sooner rather than later.

Question 42 
Hint: What is the best way to gain the commitment of the team for the team's working agreements?
Correct Answer: C 
Explanation:
The team charter is a document that records the team values, agreements, and operating guidelines, as well as establishing clear expectations regarding acceptable behavior by project team 
members. The team charter may be updated to reflect changes to the agreed-upon team operating guidelines that result from team development. The team charter works best when the team 
develops it or at least has an opportunity to contribute to it. Of the available options, discussing the issue with the team and updating the team charter accordingly is the best course of action in 
this situation.
Details for Each Option:
A  Contact the human resources department to update the corporate policies to prohibit flextime
Incorrect. Although updating the corporate policies to prohibit fextime would likely resolve the issue described by the question, this action does not represent the best way to address the Issue. 
Just because flextime has been found to be a roadblock for this particular project does not necessarily mean it will cause problems for other projects or project teams. Updating the corporate 
policies to ban flextime is an overreaction based on what has been presented by the question.
B  Submit a change request to update the team charter based on the team's inputs
Incorrect. A change request must be submitted to update any baseline or the project management plan. Project documents may or not be placed under configuration control depending on the 
standard's outlined in the configuration management plan. Since the question does not state whether or not the team charter is a configuration element, we assume the project is using standard 
practices where the team charter is not a controlled document and therefore does not require a change request to be updated.
C  Discuss the issue with the team and update the team charter accordingly
Correct. The team charter is a document that records the team values, agreements, and operating guidelines, as well as establishing clear expectations regarding acceptable behavior by project 
team members. The team charter may be updated to reflect changes to the agreed-upon team operating guidelines that result from team development. Working with the team to update the 
team charter is the best way for the project manager to address the issue described by the question.
D  Do nothing as the team has already agreed to use flextime for personal emergencies only
Incorrect. The question states that the team feels they should set a standard that flextime is only to be used for personal emergencies. However, this feeling might just be the first Impression of 
several team members. It is best when the issue is discussed by all team members, and an agreed-upon decision on the team values, agreements, operating guidelines, and expectations 
regarding acceptable behavior is made collectively and captured in the appropriate document such as the team charter. Therefore, doing nothing in this situation is not the best answer to the 
question asked.

Question 43 
Hint: The chart indicates that the earned value (EV) is currently exceeding the actual costs (AC) and planned value (PV).
Correct Answer: C
Explanation:
The earned value analysis chart indicates that the earned value (EV) is currently exceeding the actual costs (AC) and planned value (PV). Thus, the project is currently ahead of schedule and under 
budget. If the current trend is expected to continue, and there is no information presented to suggest that it will not, then the project should meet the project objectives without any corrective 
or preventive action. Therefore, no immediate action is necessary based on the information presented in this scenario.
It should be noted that any variance should be analyzed and understood. In this case, the project manager should gain an understanding of what caused the project cost and schedule plans to be 
so far off from actual performance. It is possible that the cost and schedule estimates were padded, which is against project management best practices. Regardless, analyzing and understanding 
the variances was not listed as an answer choice.

Incorrect. The chart indicates that the earned value (EV) is currently exceeding the actual costs (AC). Thus, the project is running under budget and is trending to complete under budget. 
Therefore, there is no reason to request additional funds for the project.
B  Look for options to reduce costs and improve schedule performance to meet project objectives
Incorrect. Based on the chart, the earned value (EV) is exceeding the actual costs (AC) and the planned value (PV). Thus, the project is currently ahead of schedule and under budget. Although 
reducing costs and improving schedule performance is always a good thing, this action is not necessary to meet project objectives at this point.
C  No immediate action is required in this case
Correct. It can be seen from the chart that the earned value (EV) is exceeding the actual costs (AC) and the planned value (PV). Thus, the project is currently ahead of schedule and under budget. 
Therefore, no immediate action is necessary.
D  Crash the schedule to bring it back into alignment with project objectives
Incorrect. Crashing is a technique used to shorten the schedule duration for the least incremental cost by adding resources. The chart indicates that the earned value (EV) is exceeding the 
planned value (PV). Thus, the project is currently running ahead of schedule. Therefore, there is no reason to incur the added cost and increase project risks by crashing the schedule to improve 
schedule performance.

Question 44 
Hint: This technique uses a master services agreement (MSA) to document fixed items and a lightweight statement of work to capture items that will be elaborated as the project progresses. 
Correct Answer: A
Explanation:
The scenario implies the project is in the Plan Procurement Management process. When some aspects of the procurement are well-defined up-front but others are unknown, the parties to the 
contract may use a multi-tiered contract structure. This contracting technique allows for capturing various aspects of the procurement in different documents. For example, mostly fixed items, 
such as warranties and arbitration, can be locked in a master services agreement (MSA), while more dynamic items, such as scope, schedule, and budget, can be formalized in a lightweight 
statement of work. While the scenario does not provide specific details as to what items are fixed and what are variable, of the choices provided, the multi-tiered structure best addresses the 
question asked. This structure reflects a hybrid project management approach in which part of the procurement is managed using predictive methods, while the other part is addressed with agile 
contracting techniques.
Details for Each Option:
A  Multi-tiered structure
Correct. A multi-tiered structure is an agile or hybrid contracting technique that best works for procurements in which some aspects are well-defined up-front while others are unknown. This 
technique uses a master services agreement (MSA) to document fixed items and a lightweight statement of work to capture those that are yet to be discovered
B  Cost plus award fee
Incorrect. Cost plus award fee is an example of a cost-reimbursable contract in which the seller is reimbursed based on specific criteria. This choice is an incorrect answer for two reasons: first, 
cost plus award fee is a contract, not a contracting technique, as asked by the question. Second, it does not address the essence of the question, which focuses on how to contractually handle a 
procurement that has requirements of a various degree of clarity.
C  Procurement audit
Incorrect. A procurement audit is one of the tools and techniques of the Control Procurements process. The audit is a structured review of the procurement process rather than a contracting 
technique used to address the uncertainty of requirements during the Plan Procurement Management process, as described by the scenario.
D  Request for quotation
Incorrect. Request for quotation (RFQ) is an example of a procurement document that is used as part of the Plan Procurement Management process to request price quotations from prospective 
sellers of common or standard goods or services. In the scenario, some of the goods/services are unknown and, hence, are not considered common or standard.

Question 45 
Hint: The project manager will need to begin each iteration with processes from the Project Scope Management Knowledge Area.
Correct Answer: D
Explanation:
In the scenario described, a hybrid life cycle is selected for the project. Hybrid (or adaptive) projects are intended to respond to high levels of change and require close and consistent stakeholder 
engagement. Often the full scope of the project is not understood at the beginning of the project, or it evolves during the project. Therefore, the deliverables are developed aver multiple 
iterations where a detailed scope is defined and approved at the beginning of each iteration. In a hybrid or adaptive life cycle, a high-level vision for the project is decomposed into an ordered list 
of requirements and work items which is contained in the backlog list. At the beginning of each iteration, the team determines how many of the items on the backlog list can be delivered with 
the iteration. Additionally, as the project progresses, new requirements/changes may be identified/requested. These actions are associated with the Collect Requirements process. The chosen 
requirements and work items from the backlog list are then used to define a detailed scope for that iteration, which is equivalent to the Define Scope process.
Details for Each Option:
A  Processes are not performed on a hybrid project
Incorrect. According to the scenario, the project manager selects a hybrid life cycle. Hybrid projects incorporate elements of predictive projects and adaptive (agile) projects. Predictive projects 
are typically managed using project management processes. Therefore, stating that processes are not performed on a hybrid project would be unsubstantiated.
B  Collect Requirements and Create WBS
Incorrect. With an adaptive/hybrid life cycle, the deliverables are produced over multiple iterations, and a detailed scope is defined for each iteration when it begins. However, either a backlog or 
a WBS is used to capture the work items. In the scenario, the project manager uses a backlog, therefore, the Create WBS process would not be performed.
C  Identify Stakeholders and Close Project or Phase
Incorrect. It is possible that each iteration new stakeholders will join the project and existing stakeholders will leave it, warranting the team to perform the Identity Stakeholders process. 
However, the Close Project or Phase process should only be performed once at the end of the project, which will likely coincide with the last iteration, not each iteration.
D  Collect Requirements and Define Scope
Correct. In an adaptive/hybrid life cycle, the deliverables are developed over multiple iterations. At the beginning of each iteration, the team determines how many backlog items can be 
delivered in the iteration (an equivalent of the Collect Requirements process) and define the scope of the Iteration (an equivalent of the Define Scope process).

Question 46 
Hint: What project artifact describes how a project will be closed?
Correct Answer: A
Explanation:
Since the pen design is ready to transition to the next phase, you can infer the scenario is in the Close Project or Phase process. A key action when closing a phase is transferring the ownership of 
your phase's intermediary deliverables to the proper group or organization tasked with using the output from your phase to meet the project objectives in their phase. You would consult the 
project management plan, specifically the subsidiary project life cycle description because it describes the series of phases that a project passes through from its initiation to its closure. While the 
PMBOK Guide does not explicitly state that the project management plan specifies 'who' in the next phase takes ownership of the deliverables from the previous phase, it is reasonable to 
assume that, of the choices given, only the project management plan is likely to have this information and is, therefore, the best answer to the question asked.
Details for Each Option:
A The project management plan
Correct. The project management plan defines the basis of all project work and how the work will be performed. Transferring the ownership of deliverables to the assigned stakeholders is done 
in accordance with the project management plan to facilitate project closures. The project management plan would indicate who will manage the next phase (and subsequent phases) in the 
development of the new ergonomic pen and would also identify the recipient of the final product.
B The final report
Incorrect. The final report provides a summary of the project performance, such as a summary level description of the project or phase, and objectives for scope, quality, cost, and schedule as 
well as validation Information for the output, a summary of risks/issues, and how the deliverable achieved business objectives. The final report does not include Information on who will take 
ownership of the project or phase output.
C The scope statement
Incorrect. The project scope statement is created during project planning and includes the description of the project scope, major deliverables, and exclusions. The project scope does not 
Indicate what group or organization the final pen design will transfer to at the completion of a project phase.
D The communications management plan
Incorrect. The communications management plan describes how, when, and by whom Information about the project will be administered and distributed. The communications management plan 
may include communication protocols with the group(s) or organization(s) who will take ownership of the project deliverables, but it does not explicitly states the transfer of ownership from 
phase-to-phase or who the recipient of the final output would be at the end of the project

Question 47 
Hint: Effective negotiation involves finding mutual solutions within project constraints.
Correct Answer: A
Explanation:
Proposing alternatives that balance project constraints and stakeholder objectives reflects a collaborative negotiation strategy and ensures project success.
The correct approach to resolving a conflict between a stakeholder's objective and project constraints is to propose alternative solutions that create a win-win situation. The project manager 
should act as a mediator, ensuring the stakeholder's concerns are addressed without compromising the project's success.
Why is this the best approach? A collaborative negotiation strategy fosters trust and encourages stakeholder engagement and buy-in. It ensures that project constraints (scope, schedule, budget, 
and quality) are respected while compromising where feasible. This approach mitigates risks associated with excessive stakeholder influence or rigid constraint adherence. A project manager 
must balance stakeholder expectations and project realities, focusing on mutual gains rather than unilateral decisions.
Details for Each Option:
A Propose alternative solutions that align with the project's constraints while partially addressing the stakeholder's objective.
Correct. This approach prioritizes collaboration and project constraints by proposing alternative solutions that align with the project's constraints while partially addressing the stakeholders 
objective. The project manager demonstrates leadership, adaptability, and problem-solving skills by negotiating alteratives. This maintains the stakeholder relationship while ensuring project 
feasibility. This is the best approach because it considers stakeholder needs and project constraints.
B Prioritize the stakeholder's objective over the project constraints to maintain the relationship.
Incorrect. Prioritizing the stakeholder's objective without considering constraints jeopardizes the project. While stakeholder relationships are essential, ignoring project constraints can lead to 
scope creep, cost overruns, and schedule delays. A project manager must balance stakeholder expectations with feasibility, not bindly accommodate requests.
C End the negotiation and escalate the issue to the project sponsor for resolution.
Incorrect. Escalation should be the last resort in negotiation. A competent project manager should attempt to resolve conflicts independently through effective communication and problem- 
solving. Unnecessarily escalating issues can reduce the project manager's credibility and burden higher-level management with avoidable issues.
D Accept the stakeholder's demands and revise the project plan accordingly.
Incorrect. Accepting demands without analysis can lead to unrealistic project commitments. Accepting demands without evaluating impacts on constraints, feasibility, and risks can lead to 
unrealistic commitments. This approach compromises project integrity and sets a precedent for stakeholder-driven scope changes. It can create conflicts with other stakeholders and Impact 
project performance and deliverables.

Question 48 
Hint: ISO 9000 standards represent a set of industry standards, which are widely followed by organizations.
Correct Answer: B 
Explanation:
The question implies that the project manager is performing the Manage Quality process by implementing the quality management plan. Tailoring considerations for the quality management 
processes include standards and regulatory compliance, among others. The question states that an internal audit uncovered a discrepancy with International Organization for Standardization 
(ISO) 9000 standards. ISO 9000 represents a set of industry standards, which are widely followed by organizations. Many organizations have policies requiring adherence to ISO quality standards 
as an ISO certified organization. The tailoring consideration of standards and regulatory compliance includes industry standards of which ISO 9000 is an example. The fact that the discrepancy 
was uncovered during an internal audit implies that the performing organization complies with ISO 9000 standards, otherwise there would be no reason to include this review in an audit. 
Therefore, of the available choices, the project manager most likely neglected the tailoring consideration of standards and regulatory compliance earlier in the project.
Details for Each Option:
A Continuous improvement
Incorrect. Continuous improvement should be integrated into the quality management plan for any project. However, the question is asking about compliance with industry standards (ISO 9000 
in this case), which is unrelated to continuous Improvement.
B Standards and regulatory compliance
Correct. ISO 9000 represents a set of Industry standards, which are widely followed by organizations. Although not required by law, many organizations have policies requiring adherence to ISO 
9000 quality standards. The tailoring consideration of standards and regulatory compliance includes industry standards such as ISO 9000 standard’s
C Project life cycle
Incorrect. Project life cycle addresses what phases, if any, should comprise the project. ISO 9000 represents Industry standards, which exist independently of project life cycle.
D Since the project meets all applicable government regulations, nothing was missed earlier in the project
Incorrect. Even if not required by law, following ISO 9000 standards may be required by company policy. Therefore, adhering to ISO 9000 standards may still be a project requirement. The fact 
that the discrepancy was uncovered during an internal audit implies that the performing organization compiles with ISO 9000 standards. Otherwise, there would be no reason to Include this 
review in the audit.

Question 49 
Hint: Are the quality activities working?
Correct Answer: C
Explanation:
The scenario describes the Manage Quality process. This process is sometimes called quality assurance. Manage Quality is the process of translating the quality management plans into 
executable quality activities. These activities can ideally be performed by anyone on the team with the proper training, guidance, and tools. In this scenario, the tools and methods used by the 
quality assurance lead for the quality activities have been working well. Any data captured from the activities can be used and analyzed to report the status of the project quality and control the 
quality, as needed. It is important for the project to continue these activities as part of the Manage Quality process throughout the project. Unfortunately, the project can not use its current 
subject matter expert (SME) but should seek alternatives, such as reassigning another resource to the task(s). In any case, the quality activities should not cease or pause due to a resource 
change. Therefore, of the available options, assigning another team member to carry out the originally planned quality activities is the best answer to the question asked.
Details for Each Option:
A Submit a change request to adjust the cost baseline and the schedule baseline
Incorrect. While it is reasonable to assume that some of the project work will be impacted by the departure of the QA lead, there is not enough information in the question to determine if the 
cost or schedule baseline will need to be modified. It is possible that the project has contingency reserves allocated for this risk (if it was identified during project planning) or another QA 
specialist can be acquired to fulfill the role. Anyway, without having more information, one can only speculate about the need for the change request
B Request the team to develop replacement quality activities
Incorrect. The quality management has been working well. There is no indication that the quality activities need to change.
C Assign another team member to carry out the originally planned quality activities
Correct. The quality activities are working and should continue. Since the question does not indicate that the QA lead possesses unique knowledge, another project team member can take over 
conducting these activities; or if one on the team is not available or does not possess even basic quality assurance skills, the project manager may need to acquire an outside resource for this 
activity.
D Pause quality activities until the QA lead returns to the project
Incorrect. The QA lead has been reassigned to another project. The timeline for the QA lead's return is unknown or may not happen at all. Suspending quality activities does not assure the quality 
of the project continues.

Question 50 
Hint: It is the document that justified the project.
Correct Answer: C
Explanation:
A business case contains a documented economic feasibility study used to establish the validity of the benefits of a selected component lacking sufficient definition, and that is used as a basis for 
the authorization of further project management activities. The business case has a complete cost-benefit analysis for the project. It can provide the project manager with all the initial 
information used to justify the project, allowing the project manager to re-run the cost-benefit analysis substituting the initial costs with the actual costs.
Details for Each Option:
A From the customer
Incorrect. The question is taken from the perspective of the supplier. The customer will be aware of the price charged by the supplier but will not likely have any relevant information on the 
vendor's costs and cost-benefit analysis for the project. The data for a cost-benefit analysis, including conditions that were known at the start of the project, are included in the vendors business 
documents.
B The project charter
Incorrect. The project charter defines success criteria and other measurable objectives but is not likely to have the complete cost-benefit analysis.
C The business case
Correct. The business case has the complete cost-benefit analysis for the project. It can provide the project manager with all the initial information used to justify the project. 
D The benefits management plan
Incorrect. The benefits management plan explains the processes for creating, maximizing, and sustaining the benefits provided by a project or program. It outlines the benefits of all projects and 
how they are to be maintained beyond the completion of the project. It does not have the cost-benefit analysis.

Question 51 
Hint: What would a servant leader most likely be doing?
Correct Answer: A
Explanation:
Agile project management approach emphasizes servant leadership as a way to empower teams. Unlike traditional managers, agile leaders encourage their teams to be self-organizing, self- 
directing, and empowered to make their own decisions. In other words, agile leaders enable their team members to act upon decisions the teams are making. Managers in an agile environment 
practice servant leadership by supporting and encouraging others in their endeavors so that they can perform at their highest level and continue to improve.
Details for Each Option:
A
Enabling team members to act
Correct. Agile managers are servant leaders who lead through service to the team by focusing on understanding and addressing the needs and the development of team members in order to 
enable the highest possible team performance.
B
Solving problems for the team
Incorrect. Solving problems for the team is more typical of a traditional manager than an agile leader. Agile encourages its leaders to empower teams to solve problems for themselves. If the 
team members, after several attempts, are unable to find a solution, an agile leader may consider stepping in and help.
C
Creating working agreements
Incorrect. A working agreement is a set of rules by which team members operate. For example, the team can establish the criteria for what "done" means to judge the completeness of a product 
increment; the team can decide to use the work-in-progress (WIP) limits, respect the timebox, etc. The main point here is that it is the team members, not agile leaders, who create working 
agreements.
D
Handling uncertainties and risks
Incorrect. Both agile and traditional managers have to handle uncertainties and risks. Therefore, this choice does not describe how agile leaders differ from traditional managers.

Question 52 
Hint: eXtreme Programming (XP) is known for the practice of pair programming.
Correct Answer: B
Explanation:
The question describes a project that will use a hybrid approach by combining predictive and eXtreme Programming (XP) project management frameworks. XP is most commonly associated with 
software development but might be used for other types of deliverables, as well. One of the hallmarks of XP is the use of pair programming. With pair programming, two members of the 
development work in tandem, where one writes the code, and the other reviews each line of code as it is entered. The two programmers then switch roles frequently. Since there is a budgetary 
constraint that does not permit the development team members to be physically colocated, you, as the project manager, will need to provide accommodations to support XP practices, including 
pair programming. Additionally, the members of the predictive team will need to collaborate with each other, and both teams will likely need to coordinate their activities. Providing video 
conferencing capabilities will support the collaboration requirements in a virtual environment.
Details for Each Option:
A  Documenting collaboration requirements of the XP team in the communications management plan
Incorrect. extreme Programming (XP) is one of the methodologies that falls under the agile umbrella. Agile teams do not typically require a communications management plan as the 
communication methods are inherent in the agile ceremonies. Although a communications management plan might or might not be helpful for the XP team, it is not the most critical element of 
the options provided that should be prioritized.
B  Setting up remote pairing for the XP team and providing video conferencing capabilities for both teams
Correct. One of the primary practices associated with extreme Programming (XP) is pair programming. A project manager will need to replicate this practice in a virtual environment Additionally, 
the predictive team members will need to collaborate with each other, and both teams will likely need to coordinate their activities. Providing video conferencing capabilities will support the 
collaboration requirements in a virtual environment.
C  Allocating dedicated portions of the offices to support the caves and common practice for both teams
Incorrect. A caves and common approach is a method of delineating workspace, so a development team has a common area for close collaboration and private areas where team members can 
work without distractions. Although one might argue that caves and common can be recreated in a virtual environment, this approach is typically employed when teams are collocated, which is 
not the case in this scenario.
D  No specific considerations are required as both teams can learn to collaborate as they do their job
Incorrect. It is possible that the teams will eventually collaborate. However, with all team members being geographically distributed and each team following different project management 
approaches, it is highly unlikely to count on this outcome.

Question 53 
Hint: What are the roles and responsibilities of a project manager on an agile team?
Correct Answer: B 
Explanation:
When the intensity of an argument reaches a point where a positive outcome is unlikely, the project manager should use the opportunity to coach the team towards an effective and productive 
solution. An effective and skilled project manager can accomplish this without 'managing' the team. The project manager should help by using facilitation and coaching. This facilitation can 
involve getting the entire team together to come to a consensus on the most appropriate iteration length or helping to create a safe environment for the team members to have the discussion. 
For example, the project manager could suggest the team members discuss the pros and cons of each suggested iteration length to help the team reach a consensus.
Details for Each Option:
A  Avoid being involved in the process and let the team work out toward a consensus
Incorrect. According to the scenario, the argument between the team members is intense, with little chance to reach a consensus, warranting the involvement of the project manager. Avoiding 
being involved in the process would unlikely help in achieving a positive outcome.
B  Recommend evaluating the pros and cons of each one of the suggested iteration lengths
Correct. When an argument reaches an impasse, and a positive outcome is unlikely, the project manager should facilitate the discussion between the involved parties so they can reach an 
agreement. Providing the pros and cons of each one of the suggested iteration lengths would likely soften the tension and bring the discussion down to a reasonable level.
C  Threaten the team with disciplinary actions if they are unable to come to an agreement
Incorrect. It is quite evident that threatening the team members with disciplinary actions if they are unable to come to an agreement is not the best course of action for any manager/leader, 
especially on agile projects. This answer choice can be eliminated as being unreasonable and seen as over-reaction.
D  Break the impasse by making the decision for the team before relationships are damaged
Incorrect. Agile teams are self-organizing and self-directing and must be able to decide on the iteration length. At times, when the situation warrants so, an external "force" such as a project 
manager may step in and make the decision for the team. However, according to the scenario, the discussion has not (yet) reached the level of conflict where there is a risk of relationships to be 
damaged that would warrant the intervention of an outside party.

Question 54 
Hint: How is the product scope decomposed on an agile project?
Correct Answer: C 
Explanation:
The scenario suggests that the product owner is using a waterfall approach to decompose the product scope, whereas the question indicates that an agile project management framework is 
being used. In a traditional waterfall project, the project scope is decomposed down to the work package level to create the work breakdown structure (WBS). On agile projects, on the other 
hand, the product scope is captured in the product backlog, which evolves throughout the course of the project. Agile best practices recommend that teams allocate no more than one hour per 
week for backlog refinement. Such an approach would allow the team to maximize the time spent developing the product increment rather than creating a detailed plan. Instead of attempting to 
present an updated WBS every week, the product owner should just present the overall story concept to the team and then spend no more than an hour refining the stories. This approach will 
free up time for the team, thus improving velocity.
Details for Each Option:
A  Ask the product owner to decompose the scope down to the task level and assign the tasks to the team members
Incorrect. With an agile project, the product owner prioritizes the backlog and sets the iteration goal. However, it is the development team, not the product owner, who determines the tasks that 
are required to complete the iteration goal.
B  Advise the product owner to hold two five-hour backlog refinement meetings per week to gain further clarity on the scope
Incorrect. Agile best practices suggest that teams allocate no more than one hour per week for backlog refinement to maximize the time spent developing the product increment rather than 
doing the planning. Increasing the frequency of the meetings from once to twice a week would only further negatively impact the team's velocity.
C  Coach the product owner on presenting the overall story concept with one-hour weekly backlog refinement meetings
Correct. Rather than attempting to present an updated WBS every week, the product owner should just present the overall story concept to the team and then spend no more than an hour 
refining the stories. Agile teams strive to maximize time for the actual development of the product increment rather than building detailed plans.
D  Hold a team-building exercise with the team members and product owner to improve the communication between them
Incorrect. The scenario does not suggest that there is a communication issue between the team members and the product owner warranting a team-building exercise. The essence of the 
question lies with the scope management approach rather than stakeholder interactions and/or communication.

Question 55 
Hint: How might one best determine stakeholder expectations?
Correct Answer: C 
Explanation:
Project leaders should build quality into processes and deliverables. Quality is the degree to which a set of inherent characteristics of a product, service, or result, fulfills the requirements. Once 
the project charter has been approved, one of the first activities for an agile leader is to determine the project requirements and acceptance criteria. The project requirements will influence the 
remainder of project planning and the rest of the project. Requirements can be derived from stakeholders, contracts, organizational policies, standards, or regulatory bodies. A requirements 
gathering meeting among relevant stakeholders is one method of determining the project's requirements, from which quality activities can be derived. Hence, of the choices provided, conducting 
a requirements gathering meeting with the relevant stakeholders is the best answer to the question asked.
Details for Each Option:
A  Determine the acceptance criteria by reviewing the detailed requirements outlined in the project charter Incorrect. The project charter should contain high-level requirements but would not 
typically outline the project's 'detailed' requirements. The project charter alone would not likely have sufficiently detailed information regarding the project's requirements to properly determine 
the acceptance criteria and derive the appropriate quality standards.
B  Create a work breakdown structure (WBS) by decomposing the work down to the work package level
Incorrect. A WBS is a hierarchical decomposition of the total work required to create the project's deliverables. A WBS is a common element associated with predictive projects but is not typically 
used on agile projects, like the one implied by the scenario. More importantly, the project requirements must be determined before a WBS can be created.
C  Conduct a requirements gathering meeting with relevant stakeholders and determine acceptance criteria
Correct. Once the project charter has been approved, one of the first objectives of the agile leader is to determine the project requirements and document the acceptance criteria to derive 
quality needs. A requirements gathering meeting is one method of determining the requirements that, in turn, will influence the remainder of the project.
D  Develop a graphical representation of the logical relationships among the various project activities
Incorrect. This answer choice describes the project schedule network diagram. A network diagram would typically be developed when employing a traditional waterfall project rather than an 
agile project, as is suggested in the scenario. Besides, the project requirements would need to be gathered before project activities can be determined.

Question 56 
Hint: Which stakeholders are interested in product-specific features? Who is mostly concerned with organizational interfaces? Who could help fulfilling 
security requirements?
Explanation:
Theoretically, any of the stakeholders can be interested in any of the various requirement types. While this can definitely be true in real-life situations, the 
idea, while taking the exam, is to find the 'best match' even if it does not look/sound to be a perfect/ideal combination.
For example, project sponsors are commonly high-ranking managers who endorse and provide political support for the completion of a project; therefore, 
a project sponsor would likely be interested in organizational requirements being met.
Those who will use the project deliverables (e.g., the software product developed by the project) are primarily interested in the product features; hence, 
the functional requirements are likely to be the central interest of the end users.
The foremost concern of data security experts is to make sure the product meets security requirements, policies, and regulations, making non-functional 
requirements the best match for their area of interest/expertise.
Project team members, such as developers, may be interested to see that the technical requirements are properly implemented.
For project managers, seeing the whole picture is their main focus.

Question 57 
Hint: What becomes more challenging in a virtual environment?
Correct Answer: B 
Explanation:
Communication planning becomes increasingly important in a virtual team environment. Additional time may be needed to set clear expectations, facilitate communications, develop protocols 
for resolving conflict, include people in decision making, understand cultural differences, and share credit for success. When the project team is located in the same physical space, 
communication is much easier and more effective. Face-to-face communication is richer and is the most effective form of communication. Tone and non-verbal communication may be lost in a 
virtual environment. Additionally, virtual teams lack the intangible benefits of colocated teams who are able to bond more easily and become more cohesive. Therefore, communication planning 
will require special consideration while working with a virtual team.
Details for Each Option:
A  Project expenses
Incorrect. One of the advantages of the team members working from their home offices as a virtual team is the expense savings associated with offices and physical equipment needed for 
employees if they were working in the company's offices. Therefore, project expenses are not a special consideration for a virtual team, making this choice an incorrect response. 
B  Communication planning
Correct. Communication planning becomes increasingly important in a virtual team environment. Additional time may be needed to set clear expectations, facilitate communications, develop 
protocols for resolving conflict, include people in decision making, understand cultural differences, and share credit for success. Therefore, communication planning should be specifically 
considered while the work is performed by a virtual team.
C  Pre-assigned team members
Incorrect. When physical or team resources for a project are determined in advance, they are considered pre-assigned. Whether or not the project team members were pre-assigned has no 
bearing on the team operating in a virtual environment. Therefore, this answer can be eliminated.
D  Team members with disabilities or mobility issues
Incorrect. The question states the team members will be allowed to work from their home offices. Therefore, individuals with disabilities or mobility issues will be able to work from home 
without a need to commute to their local office. Thus, no special considerations should be taken into account with the use of a virtual team when some of the team members have disabilities or 
mobility issues.

Question 58 
Hint: With incremental lifecycle, the product is reviewed as an increment is completed.
Correct Answer: C 
Explanation:
The scenario indicates that the product development phase of the project will follow an incremental project lifecycle, and suggests that the dealer training and product rollout will take a 
predictive approach. This situation implies that the project, as a whole, will adopt a hybrid project management framework. With the product development phase following an incremental 
model, the product increments can be released as they are completed. In this situation, a product demonstration should be conducted once the product increment has been developed. Having 
the dealers attend the product demonstrations virtually will allow the dealers to view the product increment and provide their feedback while minimizing the impact on the dealer's regular 
responsibilities.
Details for Each Option:
A Suggest that the dealers attend the biweekly iteration retrospective meetings
Incorrect. An iteration retrospective is a meeting aimed to learn about, improve, and adapt the process the team uses to develop the product/service of the project. Those meetings are not used 
to obtain feedback for the product.
B Collect requirements upfront and develop a detailed WBS for product development
Incorrect. Collecting comprehensive requirements upfront and developing a detailed WBS for the product should be done when using a predictive project management framework. However, the 
scenario stipulates that the product will be developed using an incremental project lifecycle. Therefore, requirements and scope will be progressively elaborated rather than planned in advance.
C  Invite the dealers to attend product demonstrations via video conference
Correct. Since the team is virtual and the dealers are dispersed nationwide, virtual tools will be needed for collaboration. Having the dealers attend the product demonstrations virtually would 
allow the dealers to provide feedback with minimal disruption to their regular duties.
D  Colocate the dealers with some of the developers for the duration of the project
Incorrect. Colocating the dealers with the development team would certainly enhance collaboration and provide maximum opportunity for the dealers to provide feedback to the development 
team. However, it is unclear as to how realistic and beneficial would it be to remove the dealers from their locations for the duration of the project and colocate them with some of the 
development team members who are also not colocated as a team.

Question 59 
Hint: There is more knowledge about the product and the work needed to develop it. However, technology is new and evolving. 
Correct Answer: D 
Explanation:
The scenario covers the subject of estimating for projects that use an adaptive development approach, as evident by the existence of the backlog and the fact the product is being produced in a 
series of sprints. Estimates are a quantitative assessment of the likely amount or outcome of a variable, such as project costs, resources, effort, or duration. As the project unfolds, the estimates 
can change based on the knowledge the team gains about the product and the work involved in developing it. Range, accuracy, and confidence are some of the aspects of estimating. At the start 
of the project, when little information is available, the range of the estimates will be relatively broad. As the project unfolds and the team becomes more experienced, the range of estimates will 
become narrower. Accuracy refers to the correctness of an estimate and is linked to the range: the lower the accuracy, the larger the potential range. Therefore, an estimate developed halfway 
through the project, such as described by the scenario, will be more accurate than the one provided at the start of the project. Confidence is less intuitive than the range and/or accuracy. 
Generally, confidence increases with experience. Experience working on a previous, similar project can help with the level of confidence. For new and evolving technologies, the confidence in 
estimates is expected to remain similar or low. Since the scenario describes a project that will use new and evolving technology, the experience the team gains developing the product is 
"negated" but the evolving technology, thus keeping the team from providing a confident estimate. Therefore, under the circumstances provided in the scenario, the team will provide an 
estimate that will most likely have a narrower range, greater accuracy, but similar (law) confidence.
Details for Each Option:
A  Wider range, greater accuracy, higher confidence
Incorrect. As the project unfolds and the team members gain more knowledge about the product, the team will be able to provide a more accurate estimate. However, greater accuracy means a 
narrower, not wider, range. For new and evolving technologies, like the one described in the scenario, the confidence is expected to stay low, not higher.
B  Narrower range, poorer accuracy, lower confidence
Incorrect. With some work completed and more knowledge about the product gained, the accuracy of the team's estimates will be greater, not poorer. The range will be narrower. Since the team 
uses new and evolving technology to develop the product, the exact effect on the confidence of the estimate is unclear. It may remain the same or get lower. 
C  Same range, same accuracy, same confidence
Incorrect. It is unreasonable to assume that after completing several sprints and gaining knowledge about the product and work involved in developing the deliverables, all aspects of estimates 
will remain the same as they were at the start of the project when little information was available. Therefore, this choice is unlikely to represent a correct answer.
D  Narrower range, greater accuracy, similar confidence
Correct. Estimates provided at the start of the project, when little is known about the product, tend to be broad and less accurate. As the project unfolds, the range of estimates narrows, and 
accuracy increases. However, confidence may remain low or similar since the team is using new technology that evolves as the project progresses.

Question 60 
Hint: What should be adjusted with strict budget requirements and when?
Correct Answer: D
Explanation:
The scenario describes a software development project where the product will be delivered incrementally, but the scope, schedule, and cost will be managed using baselines in combination with 
agile release planning, implying the project as a whole is carried out using a hybrid project management approach. Agile release planning provides a high-level summary timeline of the release 
schedule. When a product is developed incrementally based on the release plan, iteration and release review meetings can be used by the team and stakeholders to inspect the completed 
product increments regularly. During these meetings, requirements are refined for future activities, and the release plan and key variables can be adjusted. In hybrid projects with strict budget 
constraints, like the project described in the scenario, these adjustments would be applied to scope and schedule, thus helping the project manager to determine the budget based on realistic 
plans. In other words, the information in the release plan will serve as an input to the review meetings with stakeholders, which, in turn, may help the project manager determine the project 
budget.
Details for Each Option:
A  The release plan can become a part of the cost management plan.
Incorrect. The cost management plan describes how the project costs will be planned, structured, and controlled. Release plans are typically used on more agile or hybrid projects and are not 
part of the cost management plan.
B The velocity can be increased for the project to stay within budget constraints.
Incorrect. The velocity is the rate at which deliverables are produced, validated, and accepted per iteration. Increasing the velocity unreasonably can negatively affect the project team and 
eventually result in a drop in productivity. It's unclear how increasing velocity may help the project manager determine the project budget.
C  Release burndown charts can be updated with cost trend lines.
Incorrect. Burndown charts are used to visualize the remaining effort towards a specific goal. In the case of a release burndown chart, the goal is the completion of a release. A trend line In a 
burndown chart projects a likely completion date for the effort remaining, based on current progress. The trendline shows the time by which remaining work is estimated to be done, rather than 
information related to costs.
D  Review meetings with stakeholders can be used to discuss the scope and schedule.
Correct. The scenario describes a hybrid project. When agile or hybrid projects are subject to strict budgets, the scope and schedule are often adjusted to stay within cost constraints. Review 
meetings with stakeholders may expose additional Information that can be used to refine requirements, resulting in updates to the release plan and adjustments to the key release- planning 
variables.

Question 61 
Hint: Which document formally authorizes the existence of a project?
Correct Answer: C
Explanation:
The project charter is a document developed during the Initiating Process Group that formally authorizes the existence of a project and provides the project manager with the authority to apply 
organizational resources to project activities. In other words, the project charter is utilized as a catalyst for the project to move forward which is what is described in the scenario. The project 
charter is typically developed by an entity external to the project, such as the project initiator or sponsor, and is the primary output of the Develop Project Charter process. For these reasons, the 
project charter is the best answer to the question asked.
Details for Each Option:
A The business case
Incorrect. The business case is a feasibility study that determines whether the project is economically advantageous to the company. The business case lists the reasons and objectives for project 
initiation and is an input to the Develop Project Charter process. The development of the business case precedes the initiation process of a project and therefore cannot be an output of an 
initiation process.
B The scope statement
Incorrect. The scope statement is a detailed description of the project and the product the project will deliver. As an output of the Define Scope process, which is a planning process, the scope 
statement is developed by the project team and not someone external to the project
C The project charter
Correct. The project charter is a document developed during the Initiating Process Group that formally authorizes the existence of a project. An output of the Develop Project Charter process, the 
project charter is issued by someone external to the project and provides the project manager with the authority to apply organizational resources to project activities. Therefore, the project 
charter is the correct answer to the question asked.
D The approved project plan
Incorrect. The term 'approved project plan' typically refers to the project management plan which defines the way a project will be executed, monitored and controlled, and closed. The project 
management plan is developed during the Planning Process Group by the project manager and the project team and, therefore, does not describe the document mentioned in the scenario.

Question 62
Hint: Which characteristic is consistent with agile practices?
Correct Answer: D
Explanation:
Project leaders should embrace adaptability and resiliency. Adaptability refers to the ability to respond to changing conditions, while resiliency is the ability to absorb impacts and recover quickly 
from a setback or failure. In the scenario, the organization operates in the high-tech industry with new technologies emerging every few months, and the project is expected to have unstable 
requirements for its entire duration. Adaptive (agile) methodologies are best suited to projects with unstable requirements. A predictive framework typically requires the project to be planned in 
detail upfront, and changes are tightly controlled. Thus, a predictive framework works well when the requirements are well understood up front and are not likely to change. Conversely, an 
iterative and incremental life cycle incorporates planning, execution, and feedback within each iteration permitting the requirements and deliverables to be progressively elaborated. Short 
feedback loops are a fundamental component of agile projects. Integrating short feedback loops into the project workflow enhances adaptability and resiliency by ensuring that the project team 
can collect fast and frequent feedback from relevant stakeholders and increases the opportunities to adapt to emerging technologies and changes.
Details for Each Option:
A Expediting decision making to occur at the first possible moment
Incorrect. Adaptability is enhanced by deferring decision-making to the last responsible moment. By deferring decision making, more Information and alternatives to discuss will be available by 
the time a decision must be made. Making a decision too early could cause the team to pursue a less than optimal approach with an increased risk of rework
B Acquiring project team members with a highly specialized set of skills
Incorrect. Project teams with broad skill sets, rather than narrow, will enhance adaptability and resiliency. For example, a software development project would benefit from individuals with 
cooling experience as well as knowledge in testing, Integration, and business analysis. Having highly specialized team members may lead to bottlenecks.
C Limiting the exposure to tacit knowledge and leveraging explicit knowledge
Incorrect. Tacit knowledge is personal knowledge that can be difficult to articulate and share. Explicit knowledge is the type of knowledge that can be codified using symbols. Both types of 
knowledge are beneficial for projects. Limiting one type at the expense of another is unlikely to support the adaptability and resiliency of the project.
D Incorporating short feedback loops to adapt the product and process quickly
Correct. Incorporating short feedback loops Into the team's workflow enables the team to adapt quickly. This approach ensures that the project team collects fast and frequent feedback from the 
relevant stakeholders and increases the opportunities to adapt to emerging technologies on a project that is expected to have unstable requirements.

Question 63 
Hint: What is typically included in the first release of an agile project?
Correct Answer: C 
Explanation:
The use of an extreme Programming (XP) method to develop the tool and waterfall to deploy it suggests that the project is managed using a hybrid project management approach. An MVP 
(minimum viable product, or sometimes called a minimal viable product) is a functioning product but contains the least development that will satisfy early adopters. An MVP might be used to 
gather feedback from a subset of customers that can then influence the development of the remainder of the fully functioning product. Additionally, an MVP allows the organization to get the 
product to market in the shortest timeframe to gain market share and start generating revenue. Although the deployment of the tool will be managed using waterfall, the best course of action in 
this scenario to obtain early customer feedback is to plan for the development of an MVP, which will be released to a subset of customers.
Details for Each Option:
A Develop the complete set of features and showcase it at a developer's conference
Incorrect. The question states that the team needs to gather customer feedback as soon as possible. Completing the entire feature set would delay the acquisition of customer feedback beyond 
what is necessary. Additionally, getting customer feedback after the product has been completed in its entirety would expose the project to unnecessary rework in order to Incorporate the 
customers' feedback.
B Create a wireframe for the public to use and provide feedback
Incorrect. A wireframe is not an actual working product as requested by the question, not even a prototype. A wireframe is a basic visual representation of the product that has no functionality 
and, therefore, cannot be used by the target audience to provide feedback sought by the project manager in the scenario described.
C Plan for the development of an MVP for a release to a subset of customers
Correct. An MVP (minimum, or minimal, viable product) is a functioning product but contains the least development that will satisfy early adopters. An MVP might be used to gather feedback 
from a subset of customers that can then help direct and adjust the development of the remainder of the fully-functioning product
D Perform decomposition to create the work breakdown structure
Incorrect. Decomposition is used to create the work breakdown structure (WBS), which is a breakdown of the total scope of work required to produce the project's deliverables. A WBS is typically 
used on traditional projects where most of the requirements are known upfront. On agile projects, requirements are frequently defined a short time before the beginning of an Iteration. Creating 
the WBS makes little sense if the product will be changed based on users' feedback

Question 64 
Hint: How should the project manager compare actual results against targets?
Correct Answer: C
Explanation:
Technical performance analysis compares technical accomplishments during project execution to the schedule of technical achievement. It requires the definition of objective, quantifiable 
measures of technical performance, which can be used to compare actual results against targets. Such technical performance measures may include weight, transaction times, number of 
delivered defects, storage capacity, etc. In this scenario, technical performance analysis should be used to compare actual results, such as delivered defects, against performance targets. The next 
logical step is to conduct technical performance analysis.
Details for Each Option:
A Schedule a release retrospective
Incorrect. A release retrospective is a scheduled review to record lessons learned from a release. Knowledge gained may include the effectiveness of a risk response to a realized risk. However, an 
analysis must first be performed on the data regarding delivered defects before any conclusions can be drawn regarding the effectiveness of the risk response. 
B Complete a sensitivity analysis
Incorrect. Sensitivity analysis is an analysis technique to determine which individual project risks or other sources of uncertainty have the most potential impact on project outcomes, by 
correlating variations in project outcomes with variations in elements of a quantitative risk analysis model. A sensitivity analysis is not used to determine the effectiveness of a risk response.
C Conduct technical performance analysis
Correct. Technical performance analysis can be used to compare actual results, such as delivered defects, against targets. The results of the technical performance analysis can provide context for 
the raw data that has been collected.
D Perform a reserve analysis
Incorrect. Reserve analysis may be performed to determine if the remaining reserves are sufficient for the risk remaining in the project. The question is asking about the effectiveness of a risk 
response rather than an evaluation of the remaining reserves.

Question 65 
Hint: Hybrid projects combine elements of both predictive and agile methods.
Correct Answer: B 
Explanation:
Predictive project life cycles are characterized by an emphasis on the specification of requirements and detailed planning during the beginning phases of a project. Agile life cycles, on the other 
hand, are characterized by the progressive elaboration of requirements based on short iterative planning end executing cycles. Projects that are managed using hybrid methods combine 
elements of both approaches. Depending on how well or poorly the requirements are defined at the beginning of the project, the elaboration of requirements on hybrid projects will tend to 
either the predictive or agile side of the project life cycle continuum. In any case, requirements on hybrid projects will be elaborated at periodic intervals during delivery, with the time between 
the intervals being dependent on the level of detail of the requirements.
Details for Each Option:
A
Defined during the transition to the customer
Incorrect. Defining requirements during the transition to the customer make no sense. Requirements should be either defined up-front as it's done with traditionally managed projects or, at 
least, drafted at the beginning of the project and then progressively elaborated (with iterative projects) or at the beginning of each iteration (with agile projects).
B
Elaborated at periodic intervals during delivery
Correct. When a hybrid life cycle is selected for a project, requirements can be roughly defined up-front and then elaborated at periodic intervals during delivery. Depending on the way 
requirements are specified, the project hybrid life cycle may tend to be either more predictive or agile.
C
Defined up-front before development begins
Incorrect. Requirements are defined up-front before development begins in predictive, not hybrid, project life cycles. Such up-front planning is possible when requirements are stable and are 
unlikely to change significantly as the project progresses.
D
Elaborated as often as needed during delivery
Incorrect. Requirements are elaborated as often as needed during delivery in agile, not hybrid, project life cycles. Typically requirements on agile projects are vague, and only high-level 
knowledge about the product exists. Requirements are elaborated as often as needed as more information becomes available.

Question 66 
Hint: What other information should be recorded in the issue log?
Correct Answer: A 
Explanation:
Based on the scenario described, the project is in the Monitor and Control Project Work process. The question implies that the project manager is reviewing the issue log, which is an input to this 
process. The question indicates a new issue has been recorded. The issue log is a project document where information about issues is captured and monitored. According to the scenario, the 
information already recorded in the issue log includes the name of the person who raised the issue, the date the issue was captured, and a description of the issue. Other information that should 
be documented in the issue log includes the name of the person assigned to the issue, priority of the issue, target resolution date, status, and final resolution. The question indicates that 
corrective action is required, therefore, of the available choices, the next logical step for the project manager is to assign a responsible party to follow up on the issue so it can be addressed and 
then record that information in the issue log.
Details for Each Option:
A Assign a responsible party to follow up on the problem
Correct. The question impiles that the project manager is reviewing the issue log, and a new issue was documented. The next logical step for the project manager is to assign a responsible party 
to follow up on the issue and record that information in the issue log.
B Record the disposition of the change request
Incorrect. The disposition of all change requests is captured in the change log. The question is describing the issue log as opposed to the change log, and the disposition of change requests is not 
recorded in the issue log. Additionally, the question does not provide any information suggesting a change request has been submitted.
C Send the project progress report to the stakeholders
Incorrect. Typically, the communications management plan would define how project communications will be planned, structured, Implemented, and monitored for effectiveness. There is not 
enough information in the question to determine if this plan requires to send of the project progress report to stakeholders under the circumstances described in the scenario. 
D Update the lessons learned register
Incorrect. Knowledge gained during the project should be captured in the lessons learned register to Improve future performance on the project. However, based on the limited information 
available to the project manager, there are no lessons leamed to be documented at this point. Additionally, the project manager should first seek to the resolve the problem at hand before being 
concerned about updating the lessons learned register.

Question 67 
Hint: Which answer choice represents a cause-and-effect diagram?
Correct Answer: D
Explanation:
Cause-and-effect diagrams are also known as fishbone diagrams, why why diagrams, or Ishikawa diagrams. This type of diagram breaks down the causes of the problem statement identified into 
discrete branches, helping to identify the main or root cause of the problem. Of the available choices, only the why-why diagram breaks down the causes of an identified problem into discrete 
branches.
Details for Each Option:
A
Pareto diagram
Incorrect. A Pareto diagram is a type of histogram which shows how many results were generated by each identified cause. While a Pareto diagram displays the causes of the problems, it does 
not break the causes down into discrete branches.
B
Matrix diagram
Incorrect. A matrix diagram is a quality management and control tool used to perform data analysis within the organizational structure created in the matrix. Matrix diagrams are not used to 
identify the cause of a problem.
C Tornado diagram
Incorrect. Tomado diagram is a special type of bar chart used in sensitivity analysis for comparing the relative Importance of the variables. Tomado diagrams have nothing to do with the cause-
and-effect diagrams described in the scenario.
D Why why diagram
Correct. Cause-and-effect diagrams are also known as fishbone diagrams, why-why diagrams, or Ishikawa diagrams. This type of diagram breaks down the causes of the problem statement

Question 68 
Hint: Which answer choice represents an activity that can only occur later in the project?
Correct Answer: D
Explanation:
The question states that the project charter is being developed, which occurs during project initiation. Brainstorming is a data gathering technique which may be useful in the development of the 
project charter. Brainstorming is a specialized meeting led by a facilitator which can be used to gather data and solutions or ideas from stakeholders, subject matter experts, and team members 
when developing the project charter. Note, the question is asking for the activity which is least likely to be conducted during the development of the project charter. The communications 
management plan is not created until later in the project during the Plan Communications Management process. Therefore, the project manager would not be able to follow the communications 
management plan in determining the meeting attendees, making this the least likely activity to be conducted in this scenario.
Details for Each Option:
A Inviting relevant stakeholders to attend the meeting
Incorrect. A stakeholder is an Individual, group, or organization that may affect, be affected by, or perceive itself to be affected by a decision, activity, or outcome of a project. Since stakeholders 
have a vested interest in the project, it may be beneficial to seek their feedback to incorporate into the project charter.
B Ensuring that a software engineer joins the meeting
Incorrect. A software engineer can be considered a subject matter expert. Since the project in this scenario Involves software development, a software engineer will be able to provide technical 
insights that may influence the development of the project charter.
C Arranging for a facilitator to lead the meeting
Incorrect. A brainstorming session is conducted in a group environment. To ensure the meeting is run effectively and kept on track, arranging for a facilitator to lead the meeting is likely to be one 
of the actions taken by the project manager.
D Following the communications management plan to determine meeting attendees
Correct. The question states that the project charter is being developed which occurs during project initiation. The communications management plan is not created until later in the project 
during the Plan Communications Management process.

Question 69 
Hint: How might the new developer be trained without incurring costs to the project?
Correct Answer: B 
Explanation:
The question describes a situation where a project team member lacks an important competency. One of the tools and techniques associated with the Develop Team process is training. Training 
the new developer in the lacking programming language will enhance the productivity of the project team. According to the scenario, the project CPI is 0.75 implying the project is over budget. 
therefore, absorbing the required training costs is problematic for the project. However, there is another alternative which will not affect the project budget. Training costs may be supported by 
the performing organization if the added skills will be useful for future projects which is the case in the situation presented. Therefore, the best course of action is to seek approval for the 
performing organization to absorb the training costs as it will help the current project and may benefit future projects.
Details for Each Option:
A  Submit a change request to update the development approach
Incorrect. The development approach is a component of the project management plan that describes a development approach selected for the project, such as predictive, iterative, agile, or a 
hybrid model. The development approach is unlikely to change as a result of a developer being unable to code in a specific programming language
B  Seek approval for the performing organization to absorb the training costs
Correct. The project manager should seek alternatives in addressing the gap in skillset, which will not affect the project budget. In this case, training costs may be supported by the performing 
organization if the added skills will be useful for future projects.
C  Stop using this programming language on this project
Incorrect. If the programming language were becoming obsolete or does not fit in with the organization's technical strategy, then this choice might make sense. However, the question does not 
support such obsolescence or trend. It states that future projects are also expected to utilize this language. Just because a new developer lacks competence in a programming language, does not 
mean that the project should cease to use it.
D  Terminate the employment of the new developer and find a replacement
Incorrect. This answer choice represents an extreme action, which should not be necessary. Although the rationale is unknown from the question, a decision was made to add the new developer 
to the project team. The project manager should devise a strategy to develop the new team member to enhance productivity.

Question 70 
Hint: Each of the project managers needs to adopt a holistic view.
Correct Answer: B
Explanation:
Project leaders need to continually evaluate and navigate project complexity. One common source of complexity is system behavior, which is the result of dynamic interdependencies. The 
scenario describes a program comprised of five projects, each performed by a scrum team. Based on the information provided, various deliverables from each of the teams will serve as inputs to 
other teams, thus introducing interdependencies between the projects within the program. This, consequently, would increase the complexity of the projects. System thinking involves taking a 
holistic view of how the project and program elements interact with each other. Understanding how their project and its deliverables will impact the other projects and the program as a whole is 
crucial for each project manager. Applying systems thinking throughout the project life cycle is one way of navigating this increased complexity.
Details for Each Option:
A  Seek the program manager's approval of the deliverables before they move from one team to another
Incorrect. Coordinating projects within a program is one of the program manager's responsibilities. However, the responsibility to approve deliverables typically lies with other project 
stakeholders. For example, on agile projects, like those described in the scenario, the approval of the deliverables is typically the product owner's responsibility.
B  Apply systems thinking throughout the project life cycle
Correct. System thinking entails taking a holistic view of how project/program elements interact with each other. In this case, each project is interconnected with the other projects within the 
program. The project managers will need to apply systems thinking to understand how their project and its deliverables impact the other projects in the program.
C  Request that the product owner prioritizes the least complex user stories in the program backlog
Incorrect. A project/program backlog is typically prioritized according to business value. Sometimes, the riskier or more complex user stories might be prioritized so the project or program can fall 
fast. If the failure is to occur, prioritizing the least complex user stories would only delay it. Hence, prioritizing the least complex user stories makes ittle sense.
D  Enhance simplicity by minimizing the amount of work not done
Incorrect. One of the principles behind the Agile Manifesto states, "Simplicity-the art of maximizing the amount of work not done - is essential." This choice represents an incorrect answer 
because it calls for 'minimizing the amount of work not done, while the principle calls for maximizing the amount of work not done to enhance simplicity.

Question 71
Hint: Who is responsible for determining how many user stories will be developed during a sprint?
Correct Answer: A 
Explanation:
When properly using a scrum framework, the product owner prioritizes the user stories in the product backlog. The product owner, however, should not determine how many user stories will be 
completed during the sprint. Instead, it is the development team members who decide how many user stories they can commit to completing. If the product owner overcommitted the 
development team, then the sprint will likely fail to meet some or all of its objectives. Additionally, if the product owner assigns the work to the development team, then the team is less likely to 
be fully committed to completing the sprint objectives. The incorrect answer choices represent the correct application of scrum best practices or are not relevant to scrum.
Details for Each Option:
A  The product owner determined how many user stories were to be completed during the sprint
Correct. When a scrum framework is used properly, it is the development team and not the product owner who determines how many user stories will be completed during the sprint. 
B  The development team decided how many user stories were to be completed during the sprint
Incorrect. When using a scrum as a project management methodology, the development should determine how many stories will be completed during the sprint and they make a commitment to 
completing them. Since the approach described by this answer choice is consistent with scrum practices, it would not be a reason for a failed sprint. 
C  You, as the project manager, failed to assign user stories to the development team.
Incorrect. When a scrum project management framework is employed, the project manager should not assign user stories to the team. By falling" to assign user stories to the team you 
essentially acted in accordance with the Scrum frameworks and, therefore, were not the reason for the sprint to fall
D  The Gantt chart did not include enough story points
Incorrect. A Gantt chart is an example of a tool that represents the project schedule. Gantt charts are typically used in predictive project management and have nothing to do with story points. 
Regardless, not including enough story points in the sprint, rather than adding too many, is unlikely to cause the sprint to fall

Question 72 
Hint: Which data analysis technique might be useful in determining the reason for the stakeholder's resistance to the project?
Correct Answer: D
Explanation:
The question states that the stakeholder engagement plan is being created, which suggests that the Plan Stakeholder Engagement process is being performed. Root cause analysis, which typically 
utilizes Ishikawa diagrams, is a data analysis technique that is commonly used during the Plan Stakeholder Engagement process to identify underlying reasons for the level of support of project 
stakeholders in order to select the appropriate strategy to improve their level of engagement. Among the available choices, only an Ishikawa diagram can provide insight into the reason for the 
stakeholder's resistance to the project and is, therefore, the best answer to the question asked.
Details for Each Option:
A  Escalate to the project sponsor
Incorrect. It is the project manager's responsibility to communicate with stakeholders, to identify the reason for the stakeholder being resistant, and make an effort to improve their level of 
support for the project. If the stakeholder continues to be resistant, then it may make sense for the issue to be escalated to the project sponsor.
B  Update the stakeholder register
Incorrect. While it is true that the stakeholder register documents the Identification, assessment, and classification of project stakeholders and that it should be kept up to date, it is not clear 
from the question whether the stakeholder register needs an update. In addition, merely updating the stakeholder register does not help identify the reason for the stakeholder being resistant.
C  Use the mind mapping technique
Incorrect. And mapping is used to visually organize Information about stakeholders, their relationships with each other, and the organization. And mapping does not provide insight into the 
reason for the stakeholder's resistance to the project. Therefore, this is not the best answer choice.
D  Utilize an Ishikawa diagram
Correct. An Ishikawa diagram can be used for performing a root cause analysis. Root cause analysis is a data analysis technique, which identifies underlying reasons for the level of support of 
project stakeholders in order to select the appropriate strategy to improve their level of engagement.

Question 73 
Hint: Some internal stakeholders will likely need some training to effectively support the project.
Correct Answer: C
Explanation:
Agile leaders must effectively engage with stakeholders for the project to be successful. In this scenario, the question implies that the development team does not require additional training on 
agile methodologies. However, other internal stakeholders will likely need a high-level understanding of the project management framework to perform their role. For example, to provide proper 
support for the team, the stakeholders should be aware of the delivery cadence on agile projects, specifically the typical scrum 2-week sprint timebox. Having stakeholders provide feedback 
during sprint reviews is essential for the team to make the necessary changes and move forward. Therefore, the stakeholders will have to make themselves available accordingly. The stakeholders 
will also need to know that the daily scrum meetings are typically "reserved" for the team members. Etc. Thus, of the choices available, identifying the relevant internal stakeholders and 
providing introductory scrum training for them is the best course of action for the agile consultant.
Details for Each Option:
A  No action is needed because the developers are all well-versed with scrum
Incorrect. Scrum training is not likely to be needed for the development team in this scenario. However, some stakeholders external to the project team will likely need a high-level understanding 
of the framework that will be used for the project. For example, a steering committee would require some scrum knowledge to support the project effectively.
B  Have the stakeholders attend the daily scrum meetings and ask questions about scrum
Incorrect. Daily Scrum is a brief, daily collaboration meeting in which the team reports progress from the previous day, declares plans for the current day, and mentions any impediments to 
progress. Stakeholders do not typically attend these meetings, let alone ask questions about scrum, taking away from the precious team's time.
C  Conduct a seminar with relevant stakeholders covering scrum at a high-level
Correct. In order to effectively support the project, it is reasonable to assume that some internal stakeholders outside of the development will need a high-level understanding of the project 
management approach. The project manager should make provisions to provide introductory scrum training for the relevant stakeholders.
D  Submit a change request to access contingency reserves to cover scrum training costs
Incorrect. Contingency reserves are set aside to address identified risks. Although lack of training might have been identified and assigned contingency reserves, the scenario implies the project 
has not yet started; hence, a change request is not needed. Besides, agile projects, like the one described in the scenario, would not require a change request.

Question 74 
Hint: The correct answer represents a skill that is typically used during the Develop Team process rather than the Develop Project Management Plan process.
Correct Answer: D
Explanation:
The question is asking to select an answer choice that represents the interpersonal and team skill which is least likely to be useful to the project manager in gaining approval for the project 
management plan. Conflict management, facilitation, and meeting management are all skills which will be essential for the project manager to use when presenting the project management plan 
to the stakeholders to gain approval for the project management plan. Team building is among the interpersonal and team skills typically used during the Develop Team process. Team building 
refers to a set of activities that enhance the team's social relations and build a collaborative and cooperative working environment. Of the choices provided, team building is less beneficial for the 
project manager in gaining approval for the project management plan, and is, therefore, the best answer to the question asked.
Details for Each Option:
A  Conflict management
Incorrect. Conflict management skills may be necessary to bring diverse stakeholders into alignment on all aspects of the project management plan making this choice an incorrect
answer.
B  Facilitation
Incorrect. Facilitation ensures that there is effective participation, that participants achieve a mutual understanding, that all contributions are considered, and that conclusions or results have full 
buy-in according to the decision process established for the project. Since this option is likely to be useful in obtaining approval, it can be eliminated as a correct response. 
C  Meeting management
Incorrect. Meeting management skills are necessary to ensure that the presentation of the project management plan is well run. Therefore, meeting management is an incorrect answer. 
D  Team building
Correct. Team building can be described as conducting activities that enhance the team's social relations and build a collaborative and cooperative working environment. Team building is typically 
used during the Develop Team process and is not likely to be beneficial in gaining approval for the project management plan, making team building the correct response.

Question 75 
Hint: Agile Manifesto Principle #4 states, "Business people and developers must work together daily throughout the project." 
Correct Answer: B 
Explanation:
Agile Manifesto Principle # 4 states, "Business people and developers must work together daily throughout the project." Making product-related decisions without the product owner is not 
aligned with agile best practices. The absence of the product owner could cause issues, as team members may not adequately understand the needs of the business. The product owner is 
accountable for the product backlog prioritization as well as for the clarification of the backlog items for the development team. The product owner serves as the point of contact with the 
business and customers. Therefore, the project manager should contact the product owner and request them to meet with the team in order to clarify any questions the team members have 
about the product increment. While the correct answer is not elaborative enough as to why the project manager should contact the product owner on behalf of the team members, it implies the 
goal of such contact should be to ask the product owner to be more approachable. Therefore, of the choices provided, contacting the product owner on behalf of the team members represents 
the best answer to the question asked.
Details for Each Option:
A Let the senior developers make the product decisions
Incorrect. While empowered agile teams can make decisions regarding their work, product decisions should be made by business representatives, such as the product owner. 
B Contact the product owner on behalf of the team members
Correct. The project manager should contact the product owner and inform them of the team's need for clarification. It would also be a good idea to remind the product owner that regular and 
consistent feedback is an integral part of agile project success.
C Mention the availability issue during the sprint review
Incorrect. A sprint review meeting is intended to demonstrate and get feedback for the product increment developed during the sprint, rather than resolve availability issues. Even if the issue is 
raised at the sprint review, waiting until the sprint review would be too late and do nothing to remove the roadblock that the team members are facing now.
D Discuss the availability issue at the sprint retrospective
Incorrect. Having the product owner unavailable or unresponsive to the team is a serious, high-risk issue that needs to be addressed immediately. A retrospective is held at the end of the sprint 
and is intended for the team to improve their processes, rather than resolve ongoing impediments. While there is nothing wrong with discussing the issue at the retrospective, the team cannot 
afford to wait until then.

Question 76 
Hint: According to the Tuckman ladder, teams may go through five stages of development: forming, storming, norming, performing, adjourning.
Correct Answer: B 
Explanation:
The Tuckman ladder is one of the models used to describe stages of team development. This model is typically referred to by project management practitioners as part of the Develop Team 
process. The model includes five stages: forming, storming, norming, performing, and adjourning. While it is safe to say that most teams go through all five stages, some may get stuck in a 
particular stage or even regress (go back) to an earlier stage. On the other hand, projects with team members who worked together in the past might skip a stage. Each stage is distinguished by 
different dynamics among the team members resulting in various levels of team effectiveness. Team effectiveness is at its lowest level during the storming stage as the environment is 
characterized by a high degree of conflict and a lack of collaboration among the team members. As the team members begin to work together and trust each other, in other words, the 
relationships between the team members normalize (thus the name of the next stage, norming), the degree of team effectiveness increases. Teams that successfully go through the norming 
stage would eventually reach the performing stage, which is the highest level of team development. In the performing stage, the team function as a well-organized unit, and the team 
effectiveness is at its highest.
Details for Each Option:
A  Incorrect. Area A represents the forming phase of the team development model. In this phase, the team members meet and learn about the project and their formal roles and responsibilities. 
Team members tend to be independent and not as open. The scenario describes disagreements and conflicts, making this choice an incorrect answer.
B  Correct. Area B represents the storming phase of team development. During this phase, the team begins to address the project work, technical decisions, and the project management 
approach. If team members are not collaborative, the environment can become counterproductive, resulting in low team effectiveness. The scenario closely matches this description, making 
storming the best answer to the question asked.
C  Incorrect. Area C represents the norming stage of the team development model. In this phase, team members begin to work together and adjust their work habits and behavior to support the 
team. The team members learn to trust each other. The scenario describes disagreements and conflicts, making norming an incorrect answer.
D  Incorrect. Area D represents the performing stage of the team development model, where the team's performance is at its highest level. Teams that reach this level of development, function 
as well-organized units. The team members are interdependent and work through issues smoothly and effectively. The scenario describes disagreements and conflicts, making this choice an 
incorrect answer.
E  Incorrect. Area E represents the adjourning stage of the team development model. This is the last stage of the Tuckman ladder, in which the team completes the work and moves on from the 
project. The scenario implies the team is still working together (although not in harmony), suggesting adjouming is an incorrect answer.

Question 77 
Hint: Which answer choice represents the application of systems thinking?
Correct Answer: A 
Explanation:
Project leaders need to recognize, evaluate, and respond to system interactions. When interdependencies exist, project leaders need to adopt systems thinking. Systems thinking entails taking a 
holistic view of how projects and project parts interact with each other. Systems thinking is critical in dealing with complex projects with interdependencies so the organization can maximize the 
delivery of business value through the various value streams. When agile teams need to coordinate their activities to address interdependencies between various projects, as in the scenario 
provided, a scaling approach is often used. One scaling approach is to incorporate a scrum of scrums. A scrum of scrums is a meeting where representatives from each scrum team meet to 
coordinate their activities between the projects. Under the circumstances described in the scenario, where three complex agile projects with interdependencies between them are planned to be 
carried out, suggesting that the project managers establish a scrum of scrums between the projects is the best course of action for the program manager.
Details for Each Option:
A Suggest that the project managers establish a scrum of scrums between the projects
Correct. Often, interdependencies exist between projects and project teams. A scrum of scrums is a meeting where representatives from each scrum team meet to coordinate their activities 
between the projects. This approach will help ensure that the project work is completed in a coordinated manner to maximize the delivery of value for the organization. 
B Allow the project teams to work independently to expedite the delivery of value
Incorrect. The question states that interdependencies exist between the three projects. Allowing the project teams to work in isolation would make it hard to impossible for the teams to 
coordinate their work. This lack of coordination would cause impediments between the projects and would likely delay the delivery of value rather than expedite it.
C Combine the project teams into one large scrum team led by a project manager
Incorrect. Scrum teams typically consist of three to nine project team members. Large projects often require that the project be broken up into separate projects and project teams. In this case, 
combining the project teams would result in a team with 18 team members, which is significantly larger than what is recommended by agile best practices.
D Ensure that all project activities are scheduled during initial project planning
Incorrect. When requirements are known upfront, a predictive project management approach is used. This allows the development of a schedule for all project activities during initial project 
planning. However, the scenario describes agile projects, implying the requirements are vague and won't allow scheduling of 'all' activities early in the project.

Question 78 
Hint: What technique uses variables (e.g., units of output) to calculate estimates?
Correct Answer: A
Explanation:
Since the project manager has duration data from a similar project with definitive parameters, he can extrapolate the rate of producing the guardrails from the previous project to arrive at an 
estimate for the new project. This estimation technique is called parametric estimating. Parametric estimating can be used during the Estimate Activity Durations process, which is what is 
described in the question scenario. For example, since the previous project was able to install one mile of guardrail over 10 days, he could estimate that five miles of guardrail will take 50 days to 
install.
Details for Each Option:
A Parametric estimating
Correct. Parametric estimating uses an algorithm to calculate duration based on historical data and project parameters. Since the project manager has the duration parameters from previous 
projects, he can use them to calculate a duration estimate for this project. Parametric estimating can provide high levels of accuracy depending on the complexity of the variables. 
B Analogous estimating
Incorrect. A good option, but parametric estimating is a better choice because the project manager has comparable parameters to more accurately calculate the estimate. Analogous estimating is 
a gross-level estimating technique which relies on the actual duration of previous, similar projects. Also, analogous estimating is generally less accurate than other estimating techniques.
C Bottom-up estimating
Incorrect. Bottom-up estimating is a method of estimating duration by aggregating the estimates of the lower level components of the work breakdown structure. Bottom-up estimating is 
typically used when estimates cannot be made with a high degree of confidence. Since the project manager has duration data from a similar project with definitive parameters that allow him to 
provide estimates with a high degree of confidence, bottom-up estimating is not the best answer in this scenario.
D Three-point estimating
Incorrect. Three-point estimating helps determine an estimated range using most likely, optimistic and pessimistic values. This method is usually used when there is insufficient historical data or 
when using judgmental data. Parametric estimating is a better choice because the project manager does have definitive parameters that allow him to provide an estimate with a high degree of 
confidence.

Question 79 
Hint: What could prove detrimental to the successful implementation of the change? Keep in mind, the question is asking to select the least likely answer choice. 
Correct Answer: C
Explanation:
The scenario describes a project with elements of both predictive and agile project management approaches. This means the project, as a whole, is lead using hybrid methods. The project 
manager wants to introduce a process change towards more direct interaction with stakeholders; thus, making the project even more hybrid. When changing processes, it is essential to clarify 
new roles and responsibilities and update the project artifacts accordingly. It also helps to show how changes to the cost baseline could have been measured in past projects if they used variance 
analysis iteratively as opposed to the traditional earned value analysis. Connecting with other agile or hybrid practitioners in the organization is another constructive way to exchange knowledge 
and support the transformation. However, leaving change requests affecting the cost baseline out of the discussion could negate the whole idea of changing the process. Therefore, of the choices 
provided, excluding those requests from the discussion would 'least likely to convince the stakeholders of the benefits of the new process, making this choice the best answer to the question 
asked. Note, according to agile best practices, daily standup meetings are not used to discuss changes. They are intended to answer three questions, such as, "What did I do since the last 
standup?", "What is my plan for today?", and, "Are there any impediments to my progress?" However, first, the question is describing a hybrid project where agile and traditional practices 
converge, and, second, the parking lot of a daily standup meeting is the time allocated to discuss impediments and other issues after the three main questions have been addressed.
Details for Each Option:
A The cost management and change management plans will be updated to reflect the new process.
Incorrect. The cost management plan describes how the project costs will be planned, structured, and controlled. The change management plan describes how the changes to the project will be 
managed. When a process that involves changes to project costs is also changing, both plans should be updated. This may help get buy-in for the new process from those stakeholders who are 
accustomed to the traditional project management approach.
B Earned value analysis data from a previous project will be compared to iterative data accumulation.
Incorrect. When a hybrid project management approach is used, like the one suggested by the scenario, trend and variance analysis data is accumulated and assessed every iteration. This 
iterative assessment enables project managers to monitor and respond to budget variations in a timely manner. Demonstrating how a predictive project could have benefited from the Iterative 
analysis can be a powerful way to show to stakeholders why their direct Involvement can help manage project changes more effectively.
C Only those budget change requests that do not affect the project cost baseline will be discussed.
Correct. With an iterative approach described by the scenario, the Interaction with stakeholders for a discussion of changes should happen on a regular and direct basis. Discussing only minor 
changes could water down the effect and diminish the desired benefits of a more lightweight change request process. Therefore, this answer choice is least likely to support the process change 
effectively.
D Other project managers in the organization going through similar process changes will be consulted.
Incorrect. Directly and regularly involving stakeholders in change requests' discussions, as suggested by the project manager, would lead to a more hybrid project management approach than the 
one currently used. In such a situation, connecting with other agile or hybrid practitioners in the organization is a powerful way to exchange knowledge and work towards transformations 
together. This action may help the project manager persuading the stakeholders in favor of the process change.

Question 80 
Hint: The diagram presented by the question is a graph that shows the relationship between two variables.
Correct Answer: B 
Explanation:
A scatter diagram is a data representation technique that may be used as part of quality assurance. A scatter diagram, as presented in the question, is a graph that shows the relationship 
between two variables. The diagram shown in the question demonstrates very close proximity between the data points and the trendline, which indicates a strong correlation between the two 
variables. Therefore, we can surmise that the defect rate (lane departures) increases as speed increases.
Details for Each Option:
A  Affinity diagram, which shows a weak correlation between the speed and lane departures
Incorrect. An affinity diagram organizes potential causes of defects into groups showing areas that should be focused on the most. The diagram presented by the question shows the relationship 
between two variables. Therefore, this answer choice can be eliminated.
B  Scatter diagram, which shows a strong correlation between the speed and lane departures
Correct. The diagram presented by the question is a scatter diagram. This diagram demonstrates very close proximity between the data points and the trendline, which indicates a strong 
correlation between the two variables.
C  Affinity diagram, which shows a strong correlation between the speed and lane departures
Incorrect. The diagram from the question shows the relationship between two variables. An affinity diagram organizes potential causes of defects into groups showing areas that should be 
focused on the most, making this an incorrect response.
D  Scatter diagram, which shows a weak correlation between the speed and lane departures
Incorrect. The diagram demonstrates very close proximity between the data points and the trendline, which indicates a strong, not weak, correlation between the two variables. Therefore, this 
response is incorrect.

Question 81 
Hint: Where is the best place to find corporate policies for the use of social media?
Correct Answer: В
Explanation:
Communicating and working with stakeholders to meet their needs and expectations, address issues, and foster appropriate stakeholder involvement is essentially the definition of the 
Stakeholder Engagement process. According to the scenario, you want to determine what your company says about the use of social media tools to communicate and work with the stakeholders 
to meet their needs and expectations. This implies you are looking for inputs to the Manage Stakeholder Engagement process. Organizational process assets (OPAs) are one of the inputs to this 
process. Corporate policies and procedures for social media are an example of OPAs. It is typical for organizations to prohibit or provide guidelines on the use of social media when done on behalf 
of the business. You should first check the corporate policies and procedures before encouraging employees to use social media as a business tool.
Note, the scenario describes a hybrid project which involves an agile team developing the software and a traditional engineering team designing the hardware. This information, however, does 
not change the correct answer. Regardless of whether the project is predictive, agile, or hybrid, organizational process assets are the best place to find the corporate policies and procedures for 
the use of social media on projects performed by the organization.
Details for Each Option:
A Review the stakeholder register
Incorrect. The stakeholder register is a project document that captures the identification, assessment, and classification of project stakeholders. While the stakeholder register may mention 
communication preferences of some of the stakeholders, this document does not include information about the company's guideline about the use of social media tools to communicate and 
work with the stakeholders.
B Check the organizational process assets
Correct. Organizational process assets Include corporate policies and procedures for social media. You should review the company's social media policy before using social media as a business 
tool.
C Consult with the project sponsor
Incorrect. The project sponsor may or may not be aware of policies for social media. The sponsor is neither the first point of contact nor is the best source for this information.
D Check the lessons learned repository
Incorrect. Checking the lessons leamed repository is a good idea but is not the first thing you should do. Any Information that can be gleaned from past projects regarding social media is 
Irrelevant if corporate policles prohibit the use of social media or if allowed its use in the past but have been changed since then.

Question 82 
Hint: To calculate the SPI, one should divide the number of completed story points by the number of planned story points.
Correct Answer: B
Explanation:
Earned value management (EVM) is typically associated with the predictive (traditional) project management approaches. However, applying EVM metrics to projects carried out using agile 
methods can be done similarly and serve as an effective tool to measure team performance. For example, the schedule performance index (SPI) is the number of story points (features) 
completed divided by the number of the story points (features) planned. The cost performance index (CPI) is the earned value (EV, which is the value of the completed story points or features) 
divided by the actual costs incurred during the period under measurement.
The interpretation of the SPI and CPI values in agile projects are made similarly to the interpretation of those values in traditional projects. For example, an SPI less than 1.0 means the project (or 
iteration) is behind schedule, or, in other words, the team is working at a rate lower than planned. An SPI greater than 1.0 means the project (iteration) is ahead of schedule, i.e., the team is 
working at a rate higher than planned. A CPI less than 1.0 means the project (iteration) is over budget, or, in other words, the team earns less than a dollar on each dollar planned. A CPI greater 
than 1.0 indicates the project (iteration) is under budget, i.e., the team earns more than a dollar compared to each dollar planned.
The question asks to determine the SPI. Based on the explanation above, the SPI = 60/80 = 0.750. In other words, the team worked at only 75% of the rate planned. Note, the reason the result is 
shown with 3 digits after the decimal place (0.750 instead of just 0.75) is to make sure that all answer choices are displayed consistently. Obviously, 0.750 is the same value as 0.75.
Details for Each Option:
A  1.333
Incorrect. This value, 1.333, could have resulted from the following calculation: 80/60 = 1.333. However, to calculate the SPI, one should divide the number of completed story points by the 
number of planned. In the scenario, the team planned 80 story points but only completed 60. Therefore, SPI = 60/80 = 0.750.
B  0.750
Correct. In agile, the schedule performance index (SPI) can be calculated using the following formula: SPI = [number of completed story points]/[number of planned story points]. Based on the 
values provided in the scenario, SPI = 60/80 = 0.750.
C  1.143
Incorrect. This value, 1.143, could have resulted from the following calculation: $80,000/$70,000 = 1.333, where $80,000 is the planned value (PV) and $70,000 is the actual cost (AC). However, 
the SPI is calculated differently: SPI = 60/80 = 0.750, where 60 is the number of the completed story points and 80 is the number of those that were planned. 
D  0.857
Incorrect. This answer choice represents the cost performance indicator (CPI), which is the earned value (EV, the value of completed story points or features) divided by the actual costs (AC). The 
EV is 60 story points multiplied by $1,000, resulting in $60,000. The AC is given in the scenario: $70,000. Therefore, CPI = $60,000/$70,000 = 0.857.

Question 83 
Hint: Each team will define their own units of measure, which cannot be compared with each other or combined.
Correct Answer: A
Explanation:
The question indicates that the project has a schedule baseline, and the development teams are using Kanban, which suggests that the project is undertaken using a hybrid method. According to 
the scenario, the project end date is fixed, but the scope is variable, which makes scheduling and progress reporting with typical waterfall methods problematic. Additionally, the question 
indicates that each of the three project teams is working independently. Both of these factors introduce complications for measuring the overall project's progress.
One way of addressing the progress reporting issues associated with a project with variable scope and independent project teams is to use a feature chart. A feature chart uses the number of 
features rather than story points, so there is a commonality between the project teams. The individual teams might use burn charts to measure their progress, but since it's likely that each team 
will define their units of measure differently, the burn charts cannot be combined into a meaningful project burn chart. A feature chart can provide a visual aid for understanding the number of 
features that have been completed as well as the rate of feature development over time across the project teams. Therefore, a feature chart would be an ideal tool to use in the circumstances 
outlined in the scenario.
Details for Each Option:
A Feature chart
Correct. A feature chart can provide information about the features that have been completed, the features remaining, and the total number of features. Additionally, the feature chart can 
provide a visualization for the rate at which features are being developed.
B Burndown chart
Incorrect. Since each of the three teams is working independently, they will each perform their own relative sizing exercises and definitions for the units of measure. As a result, it will not be 
possible to compare teams or add velocity across teams. A burndown chart may be helpful to measure progress at the team level but not at the project level in this case. 
C Burnup chart
Incorrect. A burnup chart might be helpful for each of the teams to use to measure their progress but will not be useful to measure the progress of the project. Since each team will likely define 
their units of measure differently, you, as the project manager, will not be able to build a meaningful project level burnup chart.
D Cumulative flow diagram
Incorrect. Although the cumulative flow diagram could provide some useful information about the progress of the project, the cumulative flow diagram is designed to break down work in 
progress across a Kanban board rather than measure the project's progress.

Question 84 
Hint: What do high-performing teams need from the project manager the most?
Correct Answer: D
Explanation:
The question is in reference to the Tuckman ladder, which is one of the models used to describe team development. This model includes five stages of development that teams may go through 
including forming, storming, norming, performing, and adjourning. The question suggests that the project team had reached the performing stage of team development. Teams that reach the 
performing stage function as a well-organized unit, and the team members are interdependent and work through issues smoothly and effectively. This makes the life of project managers 
relatively easy and requires from them to mostly serve as a gateway between the project team and the stakeholders and delegate decision making to the team members.
Details for Each Option:
A Provide clear direction on the project objectives and the behavior expected from the team members
Incorrect. This answer choice describes the role of the project manager when the team is in the forming stage of their development. During the forming stage, the project team members meet 
and learn about the project and their formal roles and responsibilities. The project manager should provide clear direction on the project objectives and the behavior expected from the team 
members.
B Help the team to get through their struggle by ensuring they listen to each other and understand their differences
Incorrect. This answer choice represents the role of the project manager when the team is in the storming stage of team development. During this phase, the team begins to address the project 
work, technical decision, and the project management approach. If the team members are not collaborative or open to differing ideas and perspectives, the environment can become 
counterproductive. The team needs help from the project manager to get through their struggle, listen to each other, and understand their differences.
C Ensure the team resolves conflicts quickly and continues to work collaboratively and step in only when needed
Incorrect. This answer choice describes the role of the project manager when the team is in the norming stage of their development. During the norming stage, the team members begin to work 
together and adjust their work habits and behaviors to support the team. The team members begin to trust each other. In this phase, the best course of action for the project manager is to 
ensure the team resolves conflicts quickly and continues to work collaboratively. The project manager will step in only when needed.
D Serve as a gateway between the project team and the stakeholders and delegate decision making to the team members
Correct. This answer choice describes the role of the project manager when the team reaches its performing stage when they function as a well-organized unit, and the team members are 
Interdependent and work through issues smoothly and effectively. This is the ideal stage of team development that requires from the project manager to be a gateway between the project team

Question 85 
Hint: What area represents the low degree of both technical uncertainty and uncertainty of requirements?
Correct Answer: A 
Explanation:
A project life cycle is the series of phases that a project passes through from its start to its completion. (Note, the word "phase" in this context is used differently from how it's used in multi-phase 
projects). The project life cycle provides the basic framework for managing the project. Predictive, iterative, incremental, adaptive, hybrid are examples of a project life cycle. The selection of the 
life cycle depends on project characteristics. There are various models that can be used to describe project characteristics. One of them is the Stacey Complexity Model. The model addresses the 
degree of uncertainty as it relates to the project requirements on the one hand and how to fulfill those requirements using current knowledge and technology on the other hand. The technical 
degree of uncertainty is mapped on the horizontal axis, and the uncertainty of requirements is on the vertical axis. According to the model, as project uncertainty increases along any of those 
dimensions, so too does the risk of rework and the need to use a different project management approach.
When project requirements, as well as the technology to implement these requirements, are clear, the predictive project life cycle is typically the way to go. As the degree of uncertainty 
increases, the likelihood of changes, risk, and rework increases as well. Such projects would benefit from either iterative, incremental, adaptive, or hybrid life cycles. When both the technical 
degree of uncertainty and the degree of uncertainty in project requirements is very high, a project is considered chaos (or anarchy). Managing such a project is very hard to impossible. In the 
scenario, the project team selects a predictive life cycle, implying the project has been mapped within area A, which represents the low degree of both technical uncertainty and requirements 
uncertainty.
Details for Each Option:
A  Correct. Area A represents a low degree of both technical uncertainty and requirements uncertainty. Projects that are mapped within this area are referred to as simple projects and would 
benefit from a predictive life cycle. In the scenario, the team selects the predictive life cycle, making this choice the best answer to the question asked.
B  Incorrect. Area B represents a low-to-medium degree of both technical uncertainty and requirements uncertainty. Projects that are mapped within this area are referred to as complicated 
projects and would benefit from one of the adaptive life cycles. In the scenario, the team selects the predictive life cycle, making this choice an incorrect answer.
C  Incorrect. Area C represents projects with one uncertainty aspect being high and the other uncertainty aspect being low-to-medium. Projects that are mapped within this area are referred to 
as complex projects and would benefit from an adaptive life cycle. In the scenario, the team selects the predictive life cycle, making this choice an incorrect answer.
D  Incorrect. Area D represents a high degree of both technical uncertainty and requirements uncertainty. Projects that are mapped within this area are referred to as chaotic (or anarchy) projects 
and are unlikely to be even selected as feasible. In the scenario, the project has already been selected. Therefore, this answer choice can be eliminated.

Question 86 
Hint: An antipattern is an ineffective or counterproductive response to address an issue.
Correct Answer: C
Explanation:
An antipattern can be described as an action that is taken to resolve an issue but is ineffective and may even prove counterproductive. Since the question is asking for an antipattern, the incorrect 
answer choices represent actions that are consistent with best practices or techniques associated with root cause analysis. In this case, attempting to maximize the number of action items is 
considered an antipattern. Assigning too many action items aimed to resolve a problem may cause a distraction from performing the most important actions that may produce the best results. It 
is better to pick the top one or two actions and focus efforts on those that are most likely to be effective.
Note, the scenario describes a hybrid project that involves elements from both the traditional/predictive project management approach and agile. The fact the project manager is involved in the 
project who schedules and leads a meeting with the team, product owner, and other stakeholders indicate that the project is using a predictive project management approach. The use of 
iterations, the fact a product owner is involved in the acceptance of the product increments developed by the team are an indication that this part of the project is managed using the agile 
project management approach. While this information does not change the correct answer, it is important to understand that projects can be managed using various approaches, including 
predictive (sometimes called traditional or waterfall), agile (Scrum, Kanban, etc.), or hybrid which is a combination of both.
Details for Each Option:
A Drawing a fishbone diagram
Incorrect. A fishbone diagram is a common type of cause-and-effect diagram that is used for root cause analysis. Utilizing a fishbone diagram would not be considered an antipattern. 
B Using the five whys method
Incorrect. The five whys method is a technique where repeatedly asking "why?" breaks down the identified problem to identify the root cause. Convention suggests that five iterations are 
required to drill down to the root cause of the problem. The five whys method is a common form of root cause analysis and would not be considered an antipattern.
C Maximizing the number of action items
Correct. Maximizing the number of action items may not be an effective method of resolving the identified problem. For the greatest effectiveness, the meeting participants should focus on the 
most important action items rather than on the number of action items.
D Defining the problem statement
Incorrect. Defining the problem statement is one of the first steps for conducting a root cause analysis. Once the problem has been defined, it can be decomposed to help identify the main 
cause(s). Asking the team to define the problem statement is consistent with best practices and not considered an antipattern.

Question 87 
Hint: How can you best identify the skills needed for the project before the project is formally chartered? 
Correct Answer: A
Explanation:
According to the scenario, the business case has not been approved, suggesting that the project has not yet been initiated. You are leading an initiative that, if successful, may result in the 
approval to go ahead with the project. Since past projects show that the organization did not plan resources properly, necessitating some of the work to be contracted out, thus resulting in cost 
overruns, you want to ensure that this time the lessons are learned and proper planning is done. To understand what resources are needed for your current (potential) project, a proof of concept 
cycle can be undertaken. The proof of concept could involve prototyping, feasibility study, storyboarding, development of use cases or user stories, or any other activity that can demonstrate 
potential business value helping to get the business case approved and the project initiated. By undertaking one of the proof-of-concept activities, the project manager can determine if the skills 
needed to develop the product are available in the organization, thus ensuring that the project budget is estimated realistically and the risk of cost overruns is reduced.
Details for Each Option:
A  Start with a proof of concept
Correct. In hybrid projects, a proof-of-concept cycle can be used to explore product features and map the skills needed to develop them. Mapping the skills helps identify gaps in the organization 
and plan resources accordingly. These actions, in turn, allow the project manager to create a more realistic budget estimate and reduce the risk of cost overrun.
B  Use burndown charts for reporting
Incorrect. Burndown charts are typically used on agile projects to report work remaining in the iteration or release backlog. A burndown chart would unlikely help with the task requested in the 
scenario, which is estimating a realistic project budget based on features to be delivered and the skills required to develop them.
C  Develop a project charter
Incorrect. The project charter is the document providing the project manager with the authority to apply organizational resources to project activities. While having a charter is important for any 
project, the scenario states that the business case, which is one of the inputs to the Develop Project Charter process, is insufficiently built, preventing the development of the project charter at 
this point
D  Encourage team knowledge sharing
Incorrect. Knowledge-sharing is an essential part of every successful project. However, the scenario implies the skills and knowledge necessary to develop the product are likely unavailable in the 
organization. Therefore, it is premature, and possibly even futile, to share something that is not yet available.

Question 88 
Hint: What are inconsistencies?
Correct Answer: D 
Explanation:
Inconsistencies are also known as issues. An issue log is a record of problems, gaps, inconsistencies, and conflicts that require action, so they do not impact project performance. In this scenario, 
the project manager would have logged the inconsistencies in the issue log, which she would then review to perform corrective action. The other answer choices can be eliminated because 
inconsistencies are not changes or assumptions, and a quality report is an output of the Manage Quality process, while the scenario states the project manager is performing monitoring and 
controlling activities.
Details for Each Option:
A  Stakeholder register
Incorrect. The stakeholder register is a project document that includes the identification, assessment, and classification of project stakeholders. This project document does not contain 
information project performance issues. Therefore, this answer choice can be eliminated.
B  Change log
Incorrect. A change log is a comprehensive list of change requests submitted during the project and their current status. The disposition of all change requests is recorded in the change log as a 
project document update. The scenario describes inconsistencies (or 'issues') and not change requests, and therefore the change log is an incorrect answer.
C  Assumption log
Incorrect. An assumption log is first created during project initiation as a project document used to record all assumptions and constraints throughout the project life cycle. Inconsistencies are 
not assumptions, making this answer choice incorrect.
D  Issue log
Correct. The issue log is a project document where all the issues are recorded and tracked. The issue log will help the project manager effectively track and manage issues, ensuring that they are 
investigated and resolved. The issue log is updated throughout the project's life cycle. Therefore, the issue log is the document where the project manager would have documented the 
inconsistencies (or 'issues') and would look at to review them, making this choice the best answer to the question asked.

Question 89 
Hint: How might you take learnings from the construction of one home and apply to the other homes?
Correct Answer: A
Explanation:
The scenario describes a project with aspects of low uncertainty and risk, along with other aspects that have high uncertainty and risk. Since the performing organization has a great deal of 
experience with traditional construction methods, these aspects of the project represent little uncertainty and risk. However, the organization does not have experience with solar shingles and 
energy storage, making these aspects of the project high uncertainty and risk. One method of managing the uncertainty and risk is to combine a predictive project management framework with 
an incremental approach, resulting in a hybrid project. The construction of each home can follow the traditional waterfall framework, but also incorporate an incremental approach by building 
one home at a time (sequentially). Using the incremental approach and conducting a retrospective after the completion of each deliverable (similarly to how this process is carried out on agile 
projects) will provide the opportunity for lessons leamed to be applied to each subsequent deliverable (home), thus providing opportunities for continuous improvement throughout project 
execution.
Details for Each Option:
A  Construct the homes sequentially using a predictive model and hold a retrospective after the completion of each home
Correct. Adopting an incremental approach by constructing the homes sequentially and, after each consecutive home is built, leaming what went well and what should be improved wil allow the 
project team to gain valuable information that can be applied to the construction of the subsequent homes in the development.
B  Review the lessons learned repository during project planning and apply the knowledge gained during project execution
Incorrect. Reviewing the organization's lessons learned repository might yield some useful information regarding home construction. However, the question Indicates that this will be the 
organization's first project incorporating solar panels and energy storage. Thus, it is highly unlikely that the lessons learned repository will have information regarding energy generation and 
storage, which represents the highest risk and uncertainty for the project.
C  Build all of the homes concurrently using a predictive approach and update the lessons learned register continuously
Incorrect. Updating the lessons learned register continuously is a proper project management practice. However, building all of the homes concurrently would not provide an opportunity for 
lessons learned to be applied to the current project. For example, if the solar shingles are installed on all of the homes at the same time, any mistakes or poor practices would likely be duplicated 
across all of the homes.
D  Utilize an incremental project management approach for the development of the homes and hold a project retrospective
Incorrect. Utilizing an incremental approach is a good idea for this project. However, the project retrospective is held at the end of the project. While the project retrospective might be helpful in 
Improving performance with future projects, it will not be helpful with improving performance throughout the current project as requested by the scenario.

Question 90 
Hint: What best answer allows progressive elaboration in the sprint planning process?
Correct Answer: B 
Explanation:
Prototyping comes after the steps that involve detailed design and user interface considerations. Focusing on features and deliverables is a step to plan first to ensure thorough planning and 
accommodating continuous feedback and evolving requirements.
Setting up initial deliverables, milestones, and the priority of feature development priority provides clarity that helps the team understand the sequence of tasks along the critical path and 
establishes a clear roadmap and structure for the project.
Sprint kick-off and coding would start after the primary planning steps are completed. Critical project components, like milestones and feature priorities, make planning and organizing crucial 
earlier steps.
Revising and updating the project plan based on feedback would not be the next step. At this stage, user feedback from development will not be available. Updating the project plan comes later 
after initial development has started and feedback has been gathered.
Details for Each Option:
A  Develop prototypes of the online store to visualize the layout and functionality of the tool.
Incorrect. Prototyping is a later step that benefits from having a clear priority and plan. Without prioritization and a roadmap, prototyping might lead to unnecessary iterations and changes, 
wasting time and resources. Planning and feature development would precede this to allow for an organized and efficient development process.
B  Set up each phase's initial milestones and deliverables and determine the feature development priority.
Correct. The question asks what the next step is. In sprint planning, high-level requirements and scope are determined. The next item would be to set up milestones and deliverables and 
determine the priority of features. This establishes a structured framework, effective sprint planning, continuous feedback, and a clear roadmap. Identifying milestones and deliverables early 
helps the team anticipate potential risks.
C  Begin the development sprints that kick off the process of coding the online store.
Incorrect. The team needs to establish a detailed plan and structure for the sprints. Sprint planning and creating a backlog must be completed first before jumping into the development sprints. 
D  The team would risk doing unnecessary work that is not well-defined.
Revise and update the project plan based on the feedback received during development.
Incorrect. The team needs first to establish what they alm to achieve in the initial sprints, and only then can they gather and incorporate feedback to make iterative improvements. Part of the 
prioritization of features requires estimating tasks and organizing them based on priority and dependencies.

Question 91 
Hint: What order should each of the choices be performed? Which of the choices best covers understanding the business goals and objectives, issues, and opportunities and recommending 
proposals to address them?
Correct Answer: A
Explanation:
In this scenario, the skepticism of the other executives suggests that the proposed solution only partially, if at all, addresses the need to increase profit margins. The executive team thinks other 
alternatives and additional solutions should be considered to increase margins. In other words, the needs assessment should be performed first. The needs assessment involves understanding 
business goals and objectives, issues, and opportunities and recommending proposals to address them. Therefore, the first thing for the company to do in this situation before taking any action is 
to perform a needs assessment to evaluate options to address the competitive issues faced by the company, and only then provide recommendations.
Details for Each Option:
A
Performing a needs assessment
Correct. A needs assessment involves understanding business goals and objectives, issues, and opportunities and recommending proposals to address them. A needs assessment is typically the 
first step of the pre-project work for a new project.
B
Consulting with the project management office
Incorrect. A project management office (PMO) is a management structure that standardizes the project-related governance processes and facilitates the sharing of resources, methodologies, 
tools and techniques. While the PMO may be able to make some suggestions, there is another choice that is more immediate and should be attempted first prior to consulting with the PMO.
C
Appointing a project sponsor to create a project charter
Incorrect. Creating the project charter is the first step when starting a project, but based on the scenario, there is no agreement that automating the product line is the best way to increase profit 
margins. Pre-project work should be completed before a project sponsor can create the project charter.
D
Providing a project manager with the authority to apply organizational resources
Incorrect. The project charter authorizes the project manager to apply organizational resources to the project. The pre-project work should be completed before the project charter is created and 
a project manager is provided the authority to apply organizational resources to the project.

Question 92 
Hint: Where is knowledge gained during a project recorded?
Correct Answer: B
Explanation:
Daily standup meetings can be used by teams and stakeholders, often an agile projects, to share and discuss achievements and issues of the previous day as well as plans for the current day's 
work. The question suggests that you, as the project manager, have discovered that using daily standup meetings is beneficial in controlling the project scope. This hybrid project management 
practice, traditional scope control approach using agile methods, can be documented in the lessons leamed register, which is a project document used to record knowledge gained during a 
project so that it can be used in the current project. At the end of the project or phase, the information in the lessons learned register is transferred into the lessons learned repository as an 
organizational process asset, where it can be used to improve the performance of future projects. Therefore, of the available choices, capturing the best practice in the lessons learned register is 
the best way to prevent gold plating for the remainder of the current project and on future projects.
Details for Each Option:
A  Bring up the topic during the project retrospective
Incorrect. A project retrospective is a review scheduled at the end of a project to record lessons learned in the lessons learned register. While bringing up any best practices during a project 
retrospective is a good idea, there is no reason to walt until the end of the project to capture the best practice in the lessons learned register. Best practices should be captured in the lessons 
learned register at the time the knowledge is gained to ensure performance can be improved for the remainder of the project and then transferred to the lessons learned repository for use on 
future projects. Additionally, merely bringing up the topic during the project retrospective does not guarantee the best practice would be captured in the lessons learned register
B  Capture the best practice in the lessons learned register
Correct. The lessons learned register is a project document used to record knowledge gained during a project so that it can be used in the current project and entered into the lessons learned 
repository, where it can be used to Improve the performance of future projects. Capturing the best practice in the lessons learned register is the best course of action to prevent gold plating on 
future projects.
C  Gold plating adds customer value and should not be prevented
Incorrect. Gold plating refers to the practice of adding features or functionalities that the customer did not request. Gold plating is considered a bad practice for project management and should 
be avoided as it adds unnecessary risk to the project and uncontrollably spends project resources.
D  Ensure that the scope management plan includes daily stand-up meetings
Incorrect. The scope management plan may or may not be updated to include dally stand-up meetings as a strategy for controlling the project scope. However, this action is effective in helping to 
control scope for the current project but is unlikely to prevent gold plating on future projects as the scope management plan is specific to the current project

Question 93 
Hint: How might a development team comprised of internal and external resources best collaborate?
Correct Answer: A 
Explanation:
The scenario implies the project, as a whole, is managed in a hybrid project management approach: waterfall and Scrum. Scrum is one of the agile methods. Agile methods place a great 
emphasis on collaboration, a sentiment reflected in the Agile Manifesto that values customer collaboration over contract negotiation. Agile methods are typically selected for projects where the 
project scope cannot be well-defined at the start of the project and will be progressively elaborated as the project progresses. As a result, collaboration becomes a critical factor in the project's 
success. In this scenario, the question is asking for the contracting technique that will maximize collaboration with the vendor. With a team augmentation approach, the supplier's services are 
embedded directly into the customer's organization. Having the development team comprised of internal and external resources, working as a cohesive unit, best supports the collaborative 
efforts.
Details for Each Option:
A  Team augmentation
Correct. Team augmentation is an approach where the supplier's services are embedded directly into the customer's organization. Colocating the supplier's services with the customer will
enhance collaboration.
B  Early cancellation option
Incorrect. Including an early cancellation option in the contract could be a good idea for a project where the software is developed in short iterations, as in the scenario described. However, the 
question is specifically asking about how to maximize collaboration with the vendor. An early cancellation option has nothing to do with enhancing collaboration. 
C  Fixed-price increments
Incorrect. A fixed-price Increments contracting technique allows the buyer to decompose the project scope into fixed-price micro-deliverables. This technique provides benefits to both the buyer 
and the seller/vendor, such as control over how the money is spent (for the buyer) and limiting the financial risk (for the seller). Maximizing collaboration with the seller/vendor, however, is not 
the main goal of this technique.
D  Not-to-exceed time and materials
Incorrect. The main advantage of the not-to-exceed time and materials contracting technique is to provide the buyer with room for new ideas and Innovations that were not planned initially 
rather than increase collaboration with the seller/vendor.

Question 94 
Hint: How might one determine the appropriate amount of time and money to invest in compliance activities? 
Correct Answer: B 
Explanation:
In this scenario, the project manager has just learned about a new potential threat to regulatory compliance. This potential threat will likely require the project team to carry out additional tasks 
to comply with the regulations. Compliance activities typically do not add value and are often considered overhead for a project. Agile best practices strive to minimize overhead so resources can 
be focused on producing value. This view is summarized in one of the Agile Manifesto principles that states, "Simplicity - the art of maximizing the amount of work not done - is essential." Even 
though overhead does not directly deliver value, some overhead, like compliance with regulations, is just mandatory. In order to understand the appropriate amount of time and money to invest 
in compliance activities, the project manager should analyze the consequences of non-compliance. If the consequences of non-compliance are minimal, then fewer resources can be allocated for 
compliance and vice-versa.
Details for Each Option:
A  Review the risks during the project retrospective
Incorrect. The project retrospective is held at the end of the project. Waiting until the end of the project to analyze the newly identified threat would be too late as and not allow the results of 
the analysis to be incorporated in the development of the project's deliverables.
B  Analyze the consequences of non-compliance
Correct. Agile practitioners often view compilance as unnecessary overhead that does not deliver value to the customer. Therefore, the project manager may consider minimizing resources (time, 
money, team members) allocated for compliance. However, to understand the appropriate amount of resources to invest in compliance activities, the project manager should first analyze the 
consequences of non-compliance.
C  Submit a change request to update the risk management plan
Incorrect. If the circumstances described in this scenario were applied to a predictive project management framework, then submitting a change request to update the risk management plan 
would be a plausible answer choice. However, the scenario describes an agile project. Change requests are not typically used on agile projects.
D  Develop a cumulative flow diagram
Incorrect. A cumulative flow diagram is a tool that depicts the stages of work-in-progress. A cumulative flow diagram might be helpful in identifying bottlenecks, but it would not be helpful with 
analyzing the newly identified threat to regulatory compliance.

Question 95 
Hint: What role does leadership play in organizational change?
Correct Answer: C 
Explanation:
Transitioning an organization from traditional project management to an agile approach can be very challenging as it will likely involve significant organizational and cultural change and may take 
years to accomplish. For example, a functional organizational type that is structured in silos may need to undergo a major restructuring to adopt a matrix organizational structure to support 
cross-functional teams. The organization may at first opt to gradually transition from waterfall to hybrid and finally to an agile approach. Alteratively, the organization may want to stop at the 
hybrid stage, thus benefitting from both worlds, assuming the hybrid project management approach will meet the needs of the future projects undertaken by the organization. In any case, 
executive management's willingness to change will be a significant factor in the transition from waterfall to hybrid to agile. Visible and active executive sponsorship will be crucial to support the 
significant changes that will be required for the transition to successful. The incorrect answer choices all represent agile antipatters.
Details for Each Option:
A Provide training to ensure the employees are more highly specialized
Incorrect. Agile encourages the use of generalizing specialists over narrowly trained specialists for greater redundancy in skillsets and flexibility. Highly specialized employees will be an 
Impediment to transforming an organization from waterfall to agile.
B Transition all projects to agile at the same time
Incorrect. Transitioning all projects to agile at the same time would not likely be successful. Projects currently underway would experience severe disruption with a change in project management 
framework. A more effective strategy would be to introduce agile practices to the team Incrementally
C Seek a high-level executive willing to champion the cause
Correct. Executive management's willingness to change will be a significant factor in the transition from waterfall to agille. Visible and active executive sponsorship will be crucial in supporting 
the change.
D Ensure the work is decomposed into silos
Incorrect. Having work decomposed into silos will make the transition to agile more difficult. Instead, the focus should be on creating cross-functional teams, which will better support agility.

Hint: What type of power is derived from the ability to provide monetary or other desired items?
Correct Answer: D
Explanation:
There are numerous forms of power at the project manager's disposal that can be used to achieve project objectives. The question describes a situation where a reward is offered as an incentive 
for team members to work extra hours. Reward-oriented power is derived from the ability to provide monetary or other desired items.
Details for Each Option:
A  
Managerial
Incorrect. Managerial is a personality characteristic rather than a type of power. 
B  
Charismatic
Incorrect. Charismatic or personal is a form of power characterized by having charm and/or attraction that inspires devotion in others. While in the scenario, the project manager is trying to 
inspire devotion in the team members to work over a weekend, the project manager does it using tangible rewards rather than personal virtues.
C  
Persuasive
Incorrect. Persuasive power is the ability to provide arguments that move people to a desired course of action. The question describes a situation where a reward is being used rather than the 
power of persuasion.

Question 98 
Hint: What is being reviewed?
Correct Answer: A
Explanation:
Validate Scope is the process of formalizing acceptance of the completed project deliverables. This process can be carried out at the end of an iteration (sprint), phase, project, or any other point 
where the product work can be reviewed and inspected. Inspections are among the tools and techniques of the Validate Scope process. In the Validate Scope process, stakeholders are 
determining whether or not the scope completed is acceptable. In a project utilizing agile practices, there is a product review at some point or points in the iteration. Since most of the iteration is 
to get to a workable version for review, that often is at or near the end of the iteration. Whenever such a review happens, it is a tool and technique to examine and validate the project work and 
product deliverables.
Inspections are sometimes called reviews, product reviews, and walkthroughs.
Details for Each Option:
A  Validate the product scope
Correct. The purpose of the product reviews is to examine the product to see if meets requirements and can be accepted. This is the Validate Scope process. 
B  Manage product quality
Incorrect. Managing product quality is part of the Manage Quality process. This process is concerned with translating the quality management plan into executable quality activities. According to 
the scenario, the team is going to lead a product review with the product manager rather than translate the quality management plan into executable quality activities. 
C  Control the product scope
Incorrect. Control Scope is the process of monitoring the status of the project and product scope and managing changes to the scope baseline. There is nothing in the scenario to suggest the 
team is involved in the Control Scope process. The product review described in the scenario may lead to changes. However, the main purpose of the product review is to validate, rather than 
control, the product scope.
D  Close the project or phase
Incorrect. Close Project or Phase is the process of finalizing all activities for the project, phase, or contract. The question suggests the team is going to review the product with the product 
manager rather than finalize all activities for the project, phase, or contract.

Question 99 
Hint: What is the main reason for demonstrating the deliverable to the stakeholders at the iteration review?
Correct Answer: B 
Explanation:
The type and number of project phases in a project life cycle depend upon many variables, with the delivery cadence and development approach being the most important ones. The 
development approach, in turn, can be predictive, agile, or a combination of the two, hybrid. With the adaptive development approach, the product is typically developed using timeboxed 
iterations. Each iteration results in a working product increment - a functional deliverable. At the end of each iteration, the project team demonstrates the deliverable to the relevant 
stakeholders. The whole idea of the demonstration is to get feedback from the stakeholders and use it to prioritize the backlog and plan for the next iteration. Without the feedback, going ahead 
with the product development makes no sense because the team risks building something that won't meet the stakeholders' expectations. The scenario presents project attributes that are 
aligned with the adaptive development approach described above. However, the scenario is missing an important step - getting stakeholder feedback.
Details for Each Option:
A  Predictive; sponsor approves the deliverable.
Incorrect. With the predictive approach, most of the planning is done at the beginning of the project, and a deliverable is released at its end. While any approach can use a sponsor as one of the 
stakeholders who approve deliverables, project characteristics described in the scenario are typical of adaptive or hybrid approaches rather than predictive ones.
B  Adaptive; stakeholders provide feedback.
Correct. Producing a deliverable at the end of each iteration, demonstrating it to the stakeholders at the iteration review, and prioritizing the backlog for the next iteration are activities associated 
with an adaptive approach. However, prioritizing the backlog cannot be done without getting stakeholder feedback, which is the step missing in the scenario. 
C  Hybrid; team holds an iteration retrospective.
Incorrect. Project attributes shown in the scenario are typical for adaptive approaches and, in some cases, hybrid ones (assuming there are predictive aspects not described by the scenario). It is 
also true that an iteration retrospective takes place after the review and before planning. However, another answer choice better addresses the question asked. 
D  Adaptive; no steps are missing.
Incorrect. Producing a deliverable at the end of each iteration, demonstrating it to the stakeholders, and prioritizing the backlog for the next iteration are aspects of an adaptive approach. 
However, prioritizing the backlog cannot be done without getting stakeholder feedback. Also, a retrospective is typically held before the next iteration is planned.

Question 100 
Hint: Whether the routine work of the team should be accounted for in the iteration/release plans is the key to answering this question 
Correct Answer: C
Explanation:
In the reference provided, the author writes, "In addition to making progress on a project, many teams are responsible for support and maintenance of another system. It may be a prior version 
of the product they are working on, or it may be an unrelated system. When a team makes a commitment to complete a set of stories during an iteration, they need to do so with their 
maintenance and support load in mind." In the scenario provided, it seems as the team knew that they were responsible for supporting products that were not associated with completing the 
work on the current project. However, the team most likely missed to account for this work during the iteration/release planning. Therefore, the failure to complete and deliver the planned work 
lies with the tearn. However, this does not mean the project manager should remove support work from the next iteration onward. While the situation is not ideal, the project manager should 
explain that routine work of supporting prior releases may be included in project plans and try to come to a reasonable solution with the stakeholders, solution that would allow the team to 
complete the current project and, at the same time, support the prior releases, without too much overtime work.
One approach to account for work not directly related to the current project is first to allocate a percentage or an average amount of time typically required to accomplish these routine tasks. 
Once this is done, the time left in the iteration can be used to estimate the number of user stories (or story points, features, etc.) of the current project that can be reasonably completed in the 
time remaining. Another alternative would be to place a user story of a size equivalent to the estimated size of the support work in the iteration backlog.
Details for Each Option:
A  Agree with the stakeholders and remove all further support work from the next iterations
Incorrect. Even though the support duties seem to be negatively impacting the current project, removing all further support work from the next iterations without consulting with the 
stakeholders that were involved in the prior projects/releases and were likely those who requested the support, would be an overreaction. While removing the support work would likely help the 
current project, it would harm the customers who use the prior releases, which, in turn, may have a negative impact on the performing organization.
B Ignore the stakeholders' complain and instruct the team to continue supporting the prior releases
Incorrect. With some rare exceptions, statements that suggest ignoring stakeholders typically constitute incorrect answers.
C  Explain that routine work of supporting prior releases may be included in project plans
Correct. Routine work of supporting prior releases may be included as part of the current project/release/iteration. However, this routine work should be planned ahead and discussed at release 
and iteration planning meetings. Relevant stakeholders from the current and previous projects should be invited to ensure the plans are agreed upon by all parties involved. 
D  Request that from now on the team work overtime to complete both the planned work and support
Incorrect. It seems as if the team failed to account for the support work in the current release and did not provide a realistic estimation of what could be accomplished in the current project, thus 
resulting in unrealistic stakeholder expectations. However, requesting the team to work overtime to cover for this gap would be unfair and likely negatively impact the overall team performance.

Question 101 
Hint: What stage of team development is characterized by team members learning to trust each other? 
Correct Answer: D 
Explanation:
The question describes the Tuckman ladder of team development, which includes forming, storming, norming, performing, and adjourning as the stages of development. The norming stage of 
team development is characterized by team members adjusting their work habits and behaviors to support the team, and they learn to trust each other. The question states that the team is 
adjusting their work habits by making accommodations for team members in different time zones, and they are leaming to trust each other. Of the available options, the norming stage is aligned 
the best with the description provided by the question.
Details for Each Option:
A  Forming
Incorrect. The forming stage of team development is where team members meet and learn about the project and their formal roles and responsibilities. The question describes a team that is 
already working together and therefore has moved past the forming stage.
B  Storming
Incorrect. During the storming phase of team development, the team begins to address the project work, technical decisions, and the project management approach. Of the available choices, 
this is not the best description of the development stage outlined in the question.
C  Performing
Incorrect. Teams that reach the performing stage of team development function as a well-organized unit and work through issues smoothly and effectively. There is not enough information in the 
question to conclude that the team is already well-organized and works through issues smoothly and effectively. Another answer choice, norming, more accurately describes the current stage of 
the team.
D  Norming
Correct. The norming stage of team development is characterized by team members adjusting their work habits and behaviors to support the team, and they learn to trust each other.

Question 102 
Hint: What should the project manager do to let the team know how to implement the company's policies on the project?
Correct Answer: A 
Explanation:
It is typical to think of an adaptive (agile) project as a software development project that does not require any physical resources. However, an adaptive development approach can be applied to 
other industries, e.g., those that rely on physical resources to produce their deliverables. The scenario describes a project to develop a robotic arm that will require rare materials. Planning, 
ordering, transporting, storing, tracking, and controlling these physical resources can take a large amount of time and effort. Companies that deal with physical resources would typically have a 
policy in place that addresses those aspects. Each project that the company undertakes would have to implement the policy accordingly. A logistics plan is what connects the organizational policy 
with the project. The plan outlines how the company's policy of managing physical resources will be implemented on the project. The logistics plan often includes supporting documents, such as 
estimates for the type of material, basis of estimates, expected usage over time, etc. Having the proper logistics plan in place with appropriate supporting documentation helps ensure the 
effective and efficient use of physical resources, including minimizing scrap and waste, as asked by the question.
Details for Each Option:
A  Develop a logistics plan including supporting documentation
Correct. It's a common misconception to think that adaptive projects, like the one implied by the scenario, do not require any documentation or plans. The number of planning artifacts depends 
on and should be tailored for the project's needs. With the dependence on rare materials, going ahead with the project without any plan is irresponsible.
B  Suggest increasing the sprint length to deliver more value in each sprint
Incorrect. Increasing the sprint length will likely result in more value delivered in each sprint. However, it's unclear if this course of action will help minimize scrap and waste. Besides, it's 
reasonable to assume that the sprint length of one month has been established for a reason. Therefore, modifying it without sufficient proof would be unwarranted.
C  Remove the most wasteful user stories from the project backlog
Incorrect. Items in the backlog are typically prioritized based on their business value and, sometimes, other criteria, such as risk. If a user story brings no value, it's considered wasteful and should 
not have been in the backlog in the first place. There is not enough information in the scenario to determine if the backlog includes such user stories.
D  Hold a bidder conference to procure the materials needed for the project
Incorrect. A project that requires materials to produce its deliverables may (or may not) require reaching out to prospective bidders. There is not enough information in the scenario to determine 
if the company already possesses the materials or needs to procure them externally. Therefore, holding a bidder conference is premature.

Question 103 
Hint: Which engagement level suggests that the stakeholder is vital to the project success?
Correct Answer: D 
Explanation:
A stakeholder engagement assessment matrix supports a comparison between the current (C) engagement levels of stakeholders and the desired (D) engagement levels required for successful 
project delivery. Tonya Stewart has been identified as currently resistant to the project with the goal of having this stakeholder be a project leader. This stakeholder has the widest gap between 
the current state and desired state. Additionally, the fact that the desired state is to have this person with a leading engagement level suggests her commitment to the success of the project is 
vital. Therefore, of the available choices, the most important element to include in the stakeholder engagement plan is a strategy to improve the engagement level of Tonya Stewart.
Details for Each Option:
A  A plan to improve Marie Smith's engagement level
Incorrect. The stakeholder engagement assessment matrix indicates that the engagement level of Marie Smith is currently at the desired level. Therefore, it is not necessary to include a plan to 
improve this stakeholder's engagement level.
B  An engagement level improvement plan for Todd Young
Incorrect. Todd Young is currently supportive of the project with the desired level of neutral. Therefore, there is no reason to develop a plan to improve this stakeholder's level of engagement at 
this point in the project.
C  A strategy to address the engagement level of John Snow
Incorrect. John Snow is currently unaware of the project with the goal of having him at least neutral on the project. Although the stakeholder engagement plan should address this stakeholder's 
engagement level, the fact that the project only needs him to be neutral suggests that his involvement will not be a critical factor in the success of the project. Therefore, of the available choices, 
this is not the best answer.
D  A strategy to improve the engagement level of Tonya Stewart
Correct. Tonya Stewart has been identified as currently resistant to the project with the desired engagement level with a goal of having this stakeholder be a project leader. This stakeholder has 
the widest gap between the current state and the desired state. Additionally, the fact that the desired state is to have this person with a leading engagement level suggests her commitment to 
the success of the project is vital.

Question 104 
Hint: Ensuring stakeholder understanding and receiving feedback are crucial for effective communication.
Correct Answer: C 
Explanation:
Scheduling a follow-up meeting allows the project manager to clarify points and ensure stakeholder understanding. It also provides an opportunity to gather feedback in a structured manner. 
Effective communication is a two-way process that requires confirmation that the intended message has been received and understood. If stakeholders appear disengaged or confused, it signals 
that they may not have fully grasped the information presented. Since they did not provide feedback, the project manager cannot assume their understanding. Scheduling a follow-up meeting 
allows one to clarify key points, address questions, and ensure alignment with stakeholder expectations. This proactive approach helps prevent misunderstandings leading to issues later in the 
project.
Details for Each Option:
A  Assume the stakeholders understood the presentation and move forward.
Incorrect. Assuming understanding without confirmation is risky and may lead to misalignment. Assuming stakeholders understood the presentation without confirmation is a poor 
communication practice. Lack of engagement and confusion indicate potential misunderstandings, which, if left unaddressed, could lead to misalignment and project risks. 
B  Send an email asking stakeholders for feedback and questions.
Incorrect. Sending an email may not ensure stakeholder engagement or clear feedback. Sending an email for feedback is passive and does not ensure stakeholder engagement. Stakeholders may 
ignore the email, misunderstand the request, or hesitate to provide feedback in writing. A more interactive approach, like a meeting, is better suited to clarify doubts. 
C  Schedule a follow-up meeting to clarify and confirm stakeholder understanding.
Correct. A follow-up meeting addresses confusion and ensures alignment. Scheduling a follow-up meeting ensures an interactive discussion where the project manager can address concerns, 
clarify any confusion, and confirm stakeholder understanding. This aligns with best practices in communication management and stakeholder engagement.
D  Revise the project documentation and resend it to stakeholders for review.
Incorrect. Revising and resending documentation may not resolve the disengagement issue. Revising and resending project documentation does not guarantee that stakeholders will review it or 
understand it better. The issue is not necessarily with the documentation but the communication and engagement process.

Question 105 
Hint: The roles in managing quality for the project may differ in size and effort.
Correct Answer: D
Explanation:
It is not uncommon to hear opinions that quality is the responsibility of the quality assurance department in an organization. However, project management practitioners should understand that 
managing quality is considered the work of everybody, including the project manager, project team, project sponsor, management of the performing organization, and even the customer. All of 
these have roles in managing quality in the project, though the roles differ in size and effort.
Details for Each Option:
A  The project manager, project team, and management of the performing organization
Incorrect. The project manager, project team, and management of the performing organization all play a role in managing quality. However, the role of managing quality is not limited to these 
individuals; therefore, this is not the best answer of the available choices.
B  The project sponsor along with the project manager and project team
Incorrect. The project sponsor, project manager, and project team do have roles in managing quality. However, the management of the performing organization and even the customer have roles 
in managing quality as well. Thus, of the available choices, there is a better answer to the question asked.
C  The project manager along with the project team
Incorrect. The project manager along with the project team may have the most significant and leading role in managing quality, but other individuals and groups play a role as well. Therefore, this 
is not the best answer to the question asked.
D  The project manager, project team, project sponsor, management of the performing organization, and the customer
Correct. The project manager, project team, project sponsor, management of the performing organization, and even the customer have roles in managing quality in the project, though the roles 
differ in size and effort. Of the answer choices provided, this choice more completely covers those individuals and groups who play a role in managing quality for the project and is, therefore, the

Question 106 
Hint: Which level of agile planning establishes the number of iterations?
Correct Answer: A
Explanation:
Agile release planning provides a high-level summary timeline of the release schedule based on the product roadmap and the product vision. In the scenario, the project manager needs to 
develop a schedule for the first release, which will establish the number of iterations required. Since there is a potential impact on the schedule from another project, the project manager should 
analyze the impact and take the findings into account when developing the release plan for the current project. The assessment and evaluation of this impact could be done using the what-if 
scenario analysis, which is an example of the data analysis technique that can be used as part of the Develop Schedule process implied by the scenario. The what-if scenario analysis may typically 
help assess the feasibility of the project schedule under different conditions, thus allowing the project manager to make an informed decision as to the number of iterations required before the 
rollout.
Details for Each Option:
A Release planning
Correct. Agile release planning determines the number of iterations in the release and helps decide how much needs to be developed and how long it will take to have a releasable product based 
on business goals, dependencies, and impediments. A company-wide operating system upgrade described by the scenario represents a dependency, thus requiring the project manager to 
analyze its impact on the release planning of the ERP project
B Product roadmap
Incorrect. A product roadmap shows the anticipated sequence of deliverables over time. In agile release planning, the product roadmap drives the release plans. While it may be important to 
evaluate the overall feasibility of the roadmap in the scenario described, the number of iterations, as requested by the question, is determined at the release level, not the product roadmap level.
C Iteration backlogs
Incorrect. An Iteration backlog is a prioritized list of items (requirements, features, user stories) to be developed in an Iteration. The iteration length is typically fixed and not determined by Its 
content. The number of iterations in a release is determined by the iteration length and the time available until the rollout, rather than the content of iteration backlogs. Therefore, assessing the 
impact of the upgrade project on the iteration backlogs of the current project would not help determine the number of the iterations until rollout.
D Project charter
Incorrect. A project charter is a document that authorizes the existence of a project and provides the project manager with the authority to apply organizational resources to project activities. 
The information captured in the project charter is typically presented at a high-level and does not specify the number of iterations planned for a project, whether the project is managed using a 
traditional or agile approach.

Question 107 
Hint: How do agile teams collaborate to produce the project's deliverables?
Correct Answer: A 
Explanation:
The scenario indicates that a project team will be transitioning from a waterfall approach to an agile framework with elements of an eXtreme Programming (XP) method. Sometimes it is 
advantageous to use different project management frameworks for different phases of a project, meaning the project is taking a hybrid approach. Project teams typically collaborate in a different 
way when using predictive versus agile methodologies. Thus, it is likely that the project team will need to revise their working agreements to be tailored to the project management framework. 
Agile teams are known for being self-organizing, and, as a result, have collective ownership for delivering the project's deliverables. With a waterfall project, the project team members are more 
likely to be assigned specific tasks and are individually accountable for completing their assignments. Agile, on the other hand, and XP specifically, stresses the importance of collective code 
ownership (as it applies to software development). This collective responsibility and team accountability may need to be included as part of the social contract, as reflected by the ground rules in 
the team charter.
Details for Each Option:
A Acceptance of collective responsibility for the project's deliverables
Correct. Teams that utilize an extreme Programming (XP) method to develop the product (typically a software product) are bound by collective responsibility for delivering the project's
deliverables.
B Addition of agreements for working in a virtual environment
Incorrect. There is no indication from the question that the project team will be transitioning to a virtual environment. Additionally, agile best practices encourage the use of colocated teams. 
Therefore, transitioning to an agile framework, all else being equal, is more likely to move away from a virtual environment in favor of face-to-face communication.
C The ground rules will no longer be needed as the team will use XP
Incorrect. The ground rules can be useful regardless of the project management framework being employed. The ground rules may need to be revised for use in an agile environment but are not 
likely to be discarded.
D Accountability for the creation of highly detailed documentation
Incorrect. The Agile Manifesto values the development of working software (or completed deliverables) over comprehensive documentation. The creation of documentation should be reduced to 
the barely sufficient minimum. Thus, the creation of highly detailed documentation should be avoided unless it is a project requirement, which is not suggested by the scenario.

Question 108 
Hint: There are three main types of PMOs in organizations: supportive, controlling, directive. What would make the most sense for a controlling PMO to enforce? 
Correct Answer: A,B,D
Explanation:
There are several types of PMOs in an organization, with varying degrees of influence: supportive, controlling, and directive. A controlling PMO provides support, but also require compliance. 
Compliance may involve the adoption of project management frameworks or methodologies; the use of specific templates, forms, and tools; and conformance to governance frameworks. 
However, neither a controlling PMO nor any other type of PMO for that matter enforces local health regulations. A controlling PMO does not decide on the use of management reserves either. It 
is the directive, not controlling PMO, that assigns project managers and take control of the projects by directly managing them.
Details for Each Option:
A  Use of particular project management methodologies
Correct. A project management office with controlling influence in an organization can enforce the adoption of project management frameworks or methodologies for project teams in order to 
streamline and coordinate the application of project management processes in the organization.
B  Adoption of specific templates, forms, and tools
Correct. A controlling project management office can enforce the use of specific templates, forms, and tools for project teams in order to standardize the way the projects are managed in the 
organization. Having these artifacts streamlined across the organization may reduce the administrative burden for the project managers.
C  Adherence to local health regulations
Incorrect. While project compliance with local health regulations, if applicable, is likely to be mandatory, a project management office is typically not the governing body responsible for enforcing 
these regulations. Such a responsibility would rest with the appropriate law-making and enforcing authorities.
D  Conformance to governance frameworks
Correct. A project management office with controlling Influence in an organization can enforce conformance to governance frameworks. Such frameworks may define project status reporting 
requirements, decision-making flows, ways to provide control, direction, and coordination through people, policies, and processes, to name but a few.
E  Assignment of project managers by the PMO
Incorrect. This answer choice describes an organization with a directive PMO. Directive PMOS have a high degree of control over projects in the organizations they operate. For example, directive 
PMOs may take control of the projects by directly managing them. Project managers in such organizations are assigned by and report to the PMMO.
F  Release of management reserves
Incorrect. The decision whether management reserves should be released for a project as part of its cost or schedule management is made by the managers with authority over these reserves, 
not by the project management office with controlling influence in the organization.

Question 109 
Hint: Agile projects thrive on regular, informal communications.
Correct Answer: A
Explanation:
Open, frequent, and informal communication is the cornerstone of agile managed projects. The best form of communication is face to face conversations. Agile teams working in a collocated 
space that supports communication is ideal. Planning communications management that hinders or places boundaries on those conversations is counterproductive. A project manager needs to 
encourage more communication, not less. A project manager also needs to support the capturing and flow of communication between stakeholders. Scheduling more communication 
checkpoints, such as daily standup meetings, increases the communication exchanges. And, when possible, posting and distributing information to the team aids communication flow-whether in 
physical locations, digitized, or bath. Withholding conversations or enforcing extended quiet times is the antithesis of good communication flow.
Details for Each Option:
A Schedule frequent team checkpoints and post project artifacts in a transparent fashion
Correct. Frequent and flexible information exchanges are good for agile management projects. An open work arrangement supports that Offering checkpoint times, posting information, and 
other ways to support the sharing and access to information extends the free flow of project knowledge and communications.
B Request team members to hold off their conversations until formal meeting times
Incorrect. Agile managed projects thrive on open, constant face to face conversations amongst stakeholders. Holding conversations to designated meeting times hinders the free flow of 
Information and the Informal exchanges that occur regularly in agile projects
C Record the conversations and past them in a shared repository
Incorrect. With so many conversations occurring daily, capturing them all, storing them, and distributing them in a manner that would be relevant, useful, and not out of date would be highly 
unlikely and counterproductive.
D Designate afternoons as quiet work times
Incorrect. Team members in an agile managed project collocated in an open arrangement thrive on constant communication and ease of face-to-face conversation. Enforcing long quiet periods is 
counterproductive.

Question 110 
Hint: What do agile methodologies promote as the most efficient and effective method of communicating?
Correct Answer: C
Explanation:
With agile methodologies, formal documentation of a communication plan is typically not required because much of the communication is inherent in the agile ceremonies. Since a hybrid 
approach is being employed in this scenario, a communications management plan will likely be needed, but agile aspects of the project will require little formal documented planning. However, 
one consideration which needs to be accounted for is the increased number of face-to-face interactions that typically result from agile practices. For example, the project manager may need to 
ensure facilities are available for a war room, video conferencing, the common part of the "caves and common", meeting rooms, etc.
Details for Each Option:
A Account for an increased exchange of documentation
Incorrect. Agile methodologies prioritize face-to-face communication, whereas traditional project management is more focused on the exchange of documentation. Therefore, there will likely be 
a decreased, not increased, exchange of documentation associated with the agile aspects of the project.
B Specify the exact number of communication channels
Incorrect. When the number of stakeholders that will communicate on a project is known upfront, it is theoretically possible to calculate the number of communication channels. However, 
neither it's likely that the exact number of stakeholders is known upfront, nor is it clear what benefit will the knowledge of the exact number of communication channels bring to the project, 
specifically, to its agile aspects.
C Secure facilities to support face-to-face interactions
Correct. Agile principles favor face-to-face communication as the most efficient and effective method of conveying Information. Therefore, of the available choices, securing facilities to support 
face-to-face interactions is the best answer to the question asked.
D Deploy the project management information systems (PMIS)
Incorrect. The project management information systems (PIS) provide a set of standard tools for the project manager to capture, store, and distribute Information to project stakeholders 
according to their needs captured in the communications management plan. The PMIS applies to the project as a whole and can be equally beneficial for any project management approach,

Correct Answer: D
Explanation:
Managing a project team requires various management and leadership skills to promote teamwork and maintain a cohesive and productive environment. Conflict management, a component of 
the interpersonal and team skills grouping, is one of the skills needed. Conflict is inevitable in a project environment, as such conflict should be addressed in a timely manner. The success of a

B Recognition and rewards
Incorrect. Recognition and rewards can be used to award desirable behavior. The question describes a disagreement creating performance issues versus desirable behavior. Recognizing and 
rewarding would not be a reasonable approach to this situation.
C Training
Incorrect. Training is a tool that includes all activities utilized to increase the project team's competency. Though training may be identified as a needed element as you move forward, it is not a 
viable option to address the immediate situation.

Question 112 
Hint: What are the responsibilities of agile servant leaders?
Correct Answer: B
Explanation:
Agile project management approach emphasizes servant leadership as a way to empower teams. Servant leaders manage relationships to build communication and coordination within the team 
and across the organization. Servant leaders can have many possible titles, but the most important thing is what they do. One of the agile servant leaders' responsibilities is to support the team 
through mentoring, encouragement, and support. A vital role of the servant leader is to nurture and grow team members through and beyond their current roles, even if that means losing them 
from the team, which is what described in the scenario.
Details for Each Option:
A  No, agile leaders must ensure the team members never leave their teams
Incorrect. With some exceptions, answer choices with absolute statements such as "always", "never, etc. are typically incorrect answers. While it is beneficial for the teams to maintain their 
composition, ensuring that team members never leave their teams is unlikely to be the correct answer. Sometimes, new team members who replace veterans can bring views that may eventually 
advantageous for the team.
B  Yes, agile leaders should develop team members even if that means losing them
Correct. Through support, encouragement, and professional development, team members gain confidence, take on more significant roles, and contribute at higher levels within their 
organizations. Sometimes, team members that outgrew their roles would seek opportunities outside the organization. This can be considered a negative result of the approach described In the 
scenario. Smart organizations, however, know to retain their star employees.
C  No, agile leaders may develop team members but not beyond their current roles
Incorrect. Limiting the development of team members would have a negative effect on the personal performance of the individuals as well as the overall team performance. This may retain the 
people for the short term. However, in the long run, it is reasonable to assume that the team members would feel the lack of their personal and professional development and eventually leave.
D  Yes, agile leaders have to make sure team members eventually leave the team
Incorrect. Leaving the team should not be the ultimate goal of servant leaders. The goal is to develop the team members so that they perform better as individuals, as a team, and an 
organization. If the team members leave eventually, this could be seen as "collateral damage. The hope, however, is that speaking in financial language, return on Investment in developing the 
team members would be higher than the cost.

Question 113 
Hint: Which tool might be used to bring both teams together in a virtual environment?
Correct Answer: B
Explanation:
The scenario describes a project that is being managed using a hybrid approach by combining agile and predictive frameworks within the same project. Specifically, in this case, the software 
development team will use an agile framework, and the hardware development team will use a predictive approach. Regardless of the project management frameworks, the two teams will need 
to coordinate their efforts to build the final product closely. The ideal approach would be to colocate both teams in the same physical location, but the scenario stipulates that this is not an 
option. Therefore, the project manager can recreate physical colocation in a virtual environment with the use of a fishbowl window. This approach will allow the project teams to gain most of the 
benefits of colocation even though they are physically dispersed. The incorrect answer choices represent actions that would not likely enhance collaboration between the two groups.
Details for Each Option:
A  Use a blended agile approach
Incorrect. Blended agile is structured by combining two or more agile frameworks, elements, or practices. In this scenario, the software team, which is using an agile framework, might or might 
not use a blended agile approach, but there is not enough information presented to make this determination. More importantly, using a blended agile approach for software development would 
not likely enhance collaboration with the hardware development team.
B  Create a fishbowl window
Correct. A fishbowl window is created by setting up long-lived video conferencing links to connect dispersed teams in a virtual environment. Using a fishbowl window will bring the two 
development teams together in a virtual environment to enhance collaboration.
C  Transition the hardware team to agile
Incorrect. According to the scenario, the hardware team will use a predictive project management approach. While theoretically transitioning the team to agile is possible, it is unclear if this 
action would improve the collaboration between the two teams. The two teams will still need to coordinate their efforts regardless of the project management framework used by each.
D  Implement caves and common
Incorrect. Caves and common can be set up by creating a common area for development work and also providing offices when individual team members need to work privately. This approach 
might be used by a colocated team to enhance collaboration and productivity. However, this strategy would not likely enhance collaboration between the two geographically separated 
development teams.

Question 114 
Hint: How can the team be proactive?
Correct Answer: A
Explanation:
Projects typically encounter challenges and obstacles. Those may lead to schedule delays and cost overruns, as depicted in the scenario provided. Project leaders should embrace adaptability and 
resiliency to improve project outcomes. Resiliency refers to the project's ability to absorb negative impacts and the ability to recover quickly from a setback or failure. One strategy that can 
improve resiliency is anticipating multiple potential scenarios and preparing for multiple eventualities. There are various tools that may help simulate scenarios and suggest potential solutions. 
However, the question does not require the knowledge of any specific approach. The idea is to be more proactive in avoiding setbacks or, at least, mitigating their impact.
Details for Each Option:
A  Improve resiliency by anticipating numerous potential scenarios and preparing for multiple eventualities
Correct. Resiliency refers to the project's ability to absorb impacts and recover quickly from a setback or failure. One strategy that can improve resiliency is anticipating multiple potential 
scenarios and preparing for various negative or positive events. The next step would be to mitigate the adverse outcomes and exploit the positive ones.
B  Develop the project deliverables using an iterative and incremental project development approach
Incorrect. In the scenario, the team members hold a sprint retrospective and are looking for ways to improve the performance of the upcoming sprints. The usage of sprints suggests that the 
project is already using an incremental and Iterative development approach, making this choice an incorrect answer.
C  Starting from the next sprint planning, help the team envision deliverables rather than outcomes
Incorrect. In the scenario described, the project team members are looking to improve the project's resiliency. Envisioning outcomes over deliverables (rather than deliverables over outcomes) 
can improve adaptability and resiliency by providing an opportunity to hamess a better result than what was originally planned.
D  Report the impediments to all project stakeholders and request improvement suggestions
Incorrect. There is nothing wrong with asking for improvement suggestions. However, reporting the Impediments to all project stakeholders would be inappropriate and overreacting. The team 
should first try to resolve the issues (that are under the team's control) on their own. Reaching out to the project leader would be the next step.

others are managed using agile (the product is developed over the course of several iterations). According to the scenario, the project manager feels that one team member is less productive 
than the others. But this is likely just based on one's subjective perception, which may or may not be reflective of reality. With agile methodologies, it is the development team members, not the 
project manager, who are the experts on the project work. The project manager may lack in-depth knowledge of the work requirements compared to the team members themselves. For 
example, the identified team member might be taking on the most difficult tasks, which make it appear that their productivity is lacking. The project team members are in a much better position 
to determine if a team member holds back the team. The project manager should allow the project team members the latitude to collaborate and address relatively minor issues among 
themselves. In some cases, such as the one described in the scenario, providing direct feedback to the individual is not the best approach.
On a side note, this does not mean to imply that there is no action that should be taken by the project manager. The project manager might ensure that the team has developed and documented 
their team agreements. The project manager might dig deeper to see if there are any training needs that can be addressed. However, of the available answer choices, the best course of action for 
the project manager is to allow the project team members to address the issue if they deem necessary.
Details for Each Option:
A  Allow the project team members to address the issue if they deem necessary
Correct. Agile teams are self-organizing and self-managing. The project manager may provide servant leadership and guidance with agile best practices, but the team should collaborate to 
complete the work rather than being directed by the project manager.
B  Direct the underperforming team member to work extra hours to bridge the gap
Incorrect. A project manager should perform the role of a servant leader. An agile leader supports the project team rather than directs its activities. It would be inconsistent with agile best 
practices to direct any team member to work extra hours.
C  Call out the team member's low productivity at the upcoming iteration retrospective
Incorrect. Calling out a perceived performance issue with a particular team member in a group setting would not be appropriate. This action will likely cause friction within the group and 
between the team member and the project manager. Performance issues should be addressed in private to respect the privacy of the individuals involved. If the project was not meeting 
objectives, it might be appropriate to discuss team productivity but not place blame on a particular individual.
D  From the next iteration onward, assign the team member the easiest user stories
Incorrect. With agile methodologies, the project team collaborates to determine what user stories are assigned to which individuals. It would be inconsistent with agile best practices for the 
project manager to assign user stories to a particular team member.

Question 116 
Hint: An audit should be an independent review.
Correct Answer: B
Explanation:
An audit is a structured, independent process used to determine if project activities comply with organizational and project policies, processes, and procedures. A quality audit is usually 
conducted by a team external to the project, such as the organization's internal audit department, project management office (PMO), or by an auditor external to the organization. Having a 
project team member perform the audit negates the benefits of an independent review and might introduce bias. For example, if the project team member conducting the audit is not aware or 
misinterprets a particular procedure during project execution, then that same individual will not identify the problem during the audit. Thus, it is best to have an audit performed by an entity 
external to the project. Therefore, of the choices provided, the most likely reason these compliance gaps were not found during the audits was that the audits were conducted by a project team 
member.
Details for Each Option:
A The audits were conducted by the company's internal audit department
Incorrect. It is entirely appropriate for an audit to be performed by an internal audit department. Therefore, this action is unlikely to be the cause of the problem identified in the scenario, making 
this choice an incorrect answer.
B The audits were conducted by one of the project team members
Correct. An audit is usually performed by an entity external to the team. Having a project team member perform the audit negates the benefits of an independent review making this choice the 
best answer to the question asked.
C The audits were conducted by the project management office (PMO)
Incorrect. Performing audits is a typical function for a PMO and is not a likely cause for missing the compliance issues.
D The audits were conducted by an auditor external to the organization
Incorrect. External auditors are commonly used to ensure compliance with policies, procedures, and best practices. There is no reason to believe that using an external auditor could cause the 
problem outlined in this scenario.

Question 117 
Hint: In which type of organization does a project manager have no authority over resources?
Correct Answer: B
Explanation:
Organizational structure can affect the availability of resources and influence how projects are conducted. In a functional organization, the project manager's authority over resources is little to 
none, the project budget is managed by the functional managers, and the project manager works on project tasks part-time. Other project characteristics in a functional organization include little 
to no resource availability and part-time project management administrative staff.
Details for Each Option:
A Weak matrix
Incorrect. Even though in a weak matrix organization a project manager has low authority over resources, it is still considered an authority that the project manager can use. The scenario, 
however, describes no authority at all, making weak matrix an incorrect answer choice.
B Functional
Correct. In a functional organization, the project manager's authority over resources is little to none, the project budget is managed by the functional manager, and the project manager is 
working on project tasks part-time. Based on the scenario described, you are working in a functional organization.
C Balanced matrix
Incorrect. In a balanced matrix organization, the project manager's authority over resources is low to moderate, and the project budget is managed by both the functional manager and the 
project manager. The scenario describes no authority over resources and the budget is managed by the functional manager.
D Projectized
Incorrect. In a projectized organization, the project manager's authority over resources is high to almost total, the project budget is managed by the project manager, and the project manager is 
working on project tasks full-time. The scenario describes no authority over resources, a budget that is managed by the functional manager, and the project manager works on project tasks part-
time.

Question 118 
Hint: How much help is the project manager in this debate?
Correct Answer: B
Explanation:
As the project team is working on the project, there are going to be situations where an answer must be worked out. Sometimes these situations are complex, requiring a lot of debate and 
discussion; other times these are very simple decisions. These minor conflicts are commonplace in almost every project. A project environment that supports the decision making and trust 
among team members, so they can resolve issues and find beneficial solutions are hallmarks of high-performing teams. A project manager must assist in creating and developing such an 
environment and the team. That sometimes means backing away from situations where the project manager is not a value-add and allowing the project team to problem solve and decide. While 
this option sounds counter-intuitive, under the circumstances described in the scenario, withdrawing from the conflict and not making the decision is the best course of action for the project 
manager.
Details for Each Option:
A  Abide by the decision of the most senior team member
Incorrect. Although experience or tenure at a company may provide one with more knowledge and leverage a certain advantage, requiring the team members to go with the decision of the most 
senior person is most likely not the best way to resolve a technical issue. Sometimes, junior team members have innovative ideas that are better than the old tested approaches. 
B  Avoid being involved in the discussion and decision making
Correct. The project manager does not have the information and insight to help the team members come to a resolution. The inclusion of the project manager is not of benefit.
C  Stop the discussion and direct the team members to get back to work
Incorrect. The scenario suggests the team members are arguing over technical detall Stopping the discussion would not resolve the issue.
D  Request the human resource department's representative to step in
Incorrect. There is nothing in the scenario to suggest the issue is personal warranting the representative of the human resource department to step in.

Question 119 
Hint: What are the raw observations and measurements identified during project activities?
Correct Answer: D 
Explanation:
Work performance data are the raw observations and measurements identified during activities performed to carry out the project work. In the scenario, the project manager collects all of the 
costs, which have been authorized, incurred, invoiced, and paid. Those are best described as the work performance data. Only after these raw data have been analyzed, will it become work 
performance information. Therefore, what the project manager has gathered was the work performance data.
Details for Each Option:
A
Planned value
Incorrect. Planned value is the authorized budget assigned to scheduled work. The question describes costs that are incurred rather than the budget. 
B
Earned value
Incorrect. Earned value is the measure of work performed expressed in terms of the budget authorized for that work. The question is asking about costs and not earned value. 
C
Work performance information
Incorrect. Work performance data, once analyzed, becomes work performance information. The question indicates that the cost analysis has yet to be performed. Therefore, this choice can be 
eliminated as a correct response.
D
Work performance data
Correct. Work performance data contains data on project status such as which costs have been authorized, incurred, invoiced, and paid.

Question 120 
Hint:
Which one is a product demonstration technique that allows teams to show how the early version of the product works?
Correct Answer: A 
Explanation:
Prototyping is a method of obtaining early feedback on requirements by providing a model of the expected product before actually building it. Examples of prototypes are small-scale products, 
computer-generated 2D and 3D models, mock-ups, or simulations. Prototypes allow stakeholders to experiment with a model of the final product rather than being limited to discussing abstract 
representations of their requirements. Of the choices provided, prototyping best addresses the need of the project manager to ensure that before the actual robot is built, the team receives early 
feedback on requirements and adapts the design accordingly. Prototyping can be used on any type of project, traditional, agile, or hybrid.
Details for Each Option:
A
Prototyping
Correct. Prototyping supports the concept of progressive elaboration in iterative cycles, such as those used on agile projects described in the scenario. When enough feedback cycles have been 
performed, the requirements obtained from the prototype are sufficiently complete to move to the design or build phase.
B
Design review
Incorrect. Although a design review meeting helps the team gain early feedback from a customer, design reviews are limited to discussing abstract representations of stakeholders' requirements. 
Another answer choice better addresses the question asked.
C
Checklists
Incorrect. A checklist is a document that contains a list of items, actions, or points to be considered. Checklists can be used for various purposes in various project management processes, on 
both agile and traditional projects. However, checklists are not used for getting early feedback on requirements.
D
Business case
Incorrect. A business case is used to support the feasibility of the effort and to describe why the organization should undertake the project rather than get early feedback on requirements and 
adapt the design accordingly.

Question 121 
Hint: Determine how many story points are remaining in the project and multiply them by the cost per story point.
Correct Answer: B 
Explanation:
The scenario describes a hybrid project in which the costs are controlled using predictive methods while the team carries out their work using agile. Under these circumstances and with the 
information provided in the scenario, the traditional formulas to calculate the earned value parameters would not work. The way to calculate the ETC, in this case, is to multiply the remaining 
number of story points by the average cost per story point. The team has completed 100 story points (4 sprints with 25 story points each), which is 1/3 of the total amount of story points for the 
project. If 100 story points represent 1/3 of the total scope, then the total scope is 300 story points, leaving 200 story points remaining to be completed. Using the remaining number of story 
points on the project, 200, you need to multiply it by the average cost per story point, $575, to determine the expected cost for completing the remainder of the project. Following are the 
detailed calculations in this situation:
Total Story Points Completed = 100
Total Story Points Remaining = 200
Average Cost Per Story Point = $575
Remaining Cost for Project Completion=200* $575 = $115,000
Please note, the question is asking about the cost to complete the 'remaining' story points on the project, not the 'total' of the story points on the project.
Details for Each Option:
A  $57,500
Incorrect. $57,500 represents the cost of the story points earned rather than the expected remaining cost.
B  $115,000
Correct. The expected cost remaining for the project is $115,000, which is the product of the story points remaining, 200, and the cost per story point, 575. $14,375
Incorrect. 
C  $14,375 is the product of the average velocity (25 points) and the average cost per story point ($575), which represents the average cost per sprint rather than the estimated cost to complete 
the project.
D  $172,500
Incorrect. This answer choice represents the estimated cost for the entire project rather than just the remaining cost.

Question 122
Hint: As a rule of thumb, choices with absolute statements such as 'never, 'always', 'must, etc., typically constitute incorrect answers. Which of the remaining two choices makes more sense?
Correct Answer: D
Explanation:
Be suspicious when you see answer choices with absolute statements such as 'never, 'always', 'must', etc. With some exceptions, choices containing these words represent incorrect answers. It's 
not a MUST to follow the PMBOK Guide process while developing a project charter on an agile project. On the other hand, there is nothing that stops you from following the PMBOK® Guide 
process to develop a charter on an agile project. Agile is paperless is a made-up statement. Theoretically, you can go paperless on agile, but it is hard to see how this would be implemented in 
real-life situations.
While not ideal, the only correct choice is the one that states that agile projects do not necessarily require a formal document that represents a project charter. As stated by the authors in one of 
the references provided, "There are two ways to develop a project charter in an agile environment. One is to continue along the traditional route of preparing the paperwork needed in order to 
obtain approval. The other way presumes that either provisional funding has been awarded or that tacit approval has already occurred without the need for internal paperwork."
Details for Each Option:
A  Must follow the PMBOK® Guide processes
Incorrect. Developing a project charter on an agile project may or may not follow the PMBOKS Guide processes. It depends on the organization's policies and procedures as well as the approach 
chosen for the specific project. Even traditional projects are not supposed blindly follow the processes specified in the PMBOK® Guide.
B  Must not follow the PMBOK® Guide processes
Incorrect. Developing a project charter on an agile project may or may not follow the PMBOKS Guide processes. It depends on the organization's policies and procedures as well as the approach 
chosen for the specific project. If the organization decides to follow the PMBOK Guide, then saying that developing a project charter on an agile project must not follow the PMBOK Guide 
processes would be an incorrect statement.
C  is not required because Agile is paperless
Incorrect. While it's true that agile projects typically have less documentation than traditional projects (whether actual documents or digital ones), agile is not paperless. This is a made-up 
statement.
D  Does not necessarily require a formal document
Correct. In some instances, agile projects do not require formal documents when it comes to project charters. Examples include, but are not limited to, teams that accept contracts from outside 
sources, teams that are working on special projects, teams that are working in smaller organizations.

Question 123 
Hint: What is the best way to create a team atmosphere without bringing everyone together in the same physical space?
Correct Answer: C
Explanation:
The question suggests that the Develop Team process is being performed, and virtual teams is a tool that may be used during this process. A virtual team can use technology to create an online 
team environment to build team cohesion. In this way, the project manager can take advantage of a broader pool of candidates without paying travel expenses. The use of a virtual team is the 
best tool that the project manager can use under the circumstances provided in the question.
Details for Each Option:
A  Sensitivity analysis
Incorrect. Sensitivity analysis is an analysis technique to determine which individual project risks have the most potential impact on project outcomes. The question is asking about building team 
cohesion and not project risks.
B  Recognition and rewards
Incorrect. Recognition and rewards can be helpful in team development by recognizing and rewarding desirable behavior. However, recognition and rewards are not the best tools for building 
team cohesion.
C  Virtual teams
Correct. A virtual team can use technology to create an online team environment to build team cohesion. In this way, the project manager can take advantage of a broader pool of candidates 
without paying travel expenses.
D  Colocation
Incorrect. Colocation involves placing the project team members in the same physical location to enhance their ability to perform as a team. Although this may be the best way to build team 
cohesion, the question states that budget constraints prohibit this option.

Question 124 
Hint: What scrum ceremony would provide the shortest feedback loop?
Correct Answer: D 
Explanation:
In this scenario, a scrum team and a predictive team are working on the same project. A project team that uses a traditional waterfall approach does not typically require short feedback loops 
compared to an agile team since the predictive approach has team tasks planned in advance. According to the scenario, the predictive team needs to be kept apprised of the scrum team's 
activities due to dependencies between the teams' deliverables. One of the ceremonies associated with scrum is the daily standup meeting (also known as the daily scrum). During a daily 
standup meeting, each project team member describes what they accomplished since the previous daily scrum (typically, from yesterday), what they plan to accomplish today, and informs if 
there are any impediments to progress. Having the predictive team members attend the daily scrum will allow them to be apprised of the scrum teams activities and help with the coordination 
of dependent activities.
Details for Each Option:
A  Include a project retrospective into the project schedule
Incorrect. A project retrospective provides the project teams with an opportunity to inspect and adapt their processes to improve future performance. Typically, the retrospective takes place at 
the end of the project, making the collaboration during project execution hardly achievable.
B  Request that the scrum team use information radiators
Incorrect. An information radiator is a highly visible physical display that provides information to the rest of the organization. Information radiators are a form of one-way communication. The use 
of feedback loops implies the need for two-way communication. With an information radiator, there is no way to close the loop.
C  Incorporate the use of periodic customer feedback loops
Incorrect. Customer feedback loops may very well be an essential aspect of the project. However, the scenario is specifically asking about how the two project teams will coordinate their efforts, 
rather than gathering feedback from customers.
D  Have the predictive team attend the daily scrum meetings
Correct. Having the predictive team attend the scrum team's daily standup will provide a daily opportunity for the predictive team to be apprised of what the scrum team has accomplished and is 
planning to accomplish.

Question 125 
Hint: Which of the following includes information on the composition of the team?
Correct Answer: B
Explanation:
Using existing knowledge and creating new knowledge for a project is essentially the definition of the Manage Project Knowledge process. When the knowledge that the project has is compared 
to its knowledge needs, then the gaps in knowledge can be identified and addressed. Specifically, the resource breakdown structure, as it pertains to the Manage Project Knowledge process, 
includes information on the composition of the team and may help to understand what knowledge is available as a group and what knowledge may be missing.
Details for Each Option:
A Bid documents
Incorrect. Bid documents are used to solicit information, quotations, or proposal from prospective sellers. First, it is not clear from the scenario if the project involves sellers. Second, even if it 
does, the information included in the bid documents is limited to the work outsourced to the sellers.
B Resource breakdown structure
Correct. The resource breakdown structure is a hierarchical representation of resources by category and type. The resource breakdown structure is one of the project documents that serve as an 
input for the Manage Project Knowledge process described in the scenario. The resource breakdown structure includes information on the composition of the team and may help to understand 
what knowledge is available as a group and what knowledge is missing
C Quality metrics
Incorrect. A quality metric is a description of a project or product attribute and the way the Control Quality process will verify compliance to it. Quality metrics have little to do with using and 
preservice knowledge on a project.
D To-complete performance index
Incorrect. The to-complete performance index (TCPI) is a measure of the cost performance that is required to be achieved with the remaining resources in order to meet a specified management 
goal. The TCPI is just one piece of information, while the goal of the project manager in the scenario provided is to use existing knowledge and create new knowledge for the project. It does not 
seem reasonable that the TCPI can help in accomplishing this goal.

Question 126 
Hint: This tool/technique is also called an inspection.
Correct Answer: A
Explanation:
The question suggests that the Control Procurements process is underway. An inspection, as it relates to the Control Procurements process, is a structured review of the work being performed by 
the vendor. The inspection may involve a simple review of the deliverables or an actual physical review of the work itself. On a construction project, inspections may involve walkthroughs of the 
site by both the buyer and the vendor to ensure a mutual understanding of the work in progress.
One may argue that the team member has the figures of the work in progress, allowing the implementation of the earned value analysis (EVA), and, hence, making the EVA a better answer 
choice. This is not the case, since, according to the scenario, the team member has only a 'rough' assessment of the vendor's current work in progress, and she 'suspects' that the vendor will be 
unable to complete the work on time. Project managers should not act on suspicions. Facts should be checked, making a walkthrough a better answer.
Details for Each Option:
A  Conduct a walkthrough
Correct. An inspection is a structured review of the work being performed by the vendor. On a construction project, inspections may involve walkthroughs of the site by both the buyer and the 
vendor to ensure a mutual understanding of the work in progress.
B  Perform an eamed value analysis (EVA)
Incorrect. In order to perform an earned value analysis (EVA), you, as the project manager, must first have a clear understanding of the progress which has been completed. In this scenario, the 
status of the work in progress is in dispute and, therefore, is unknown.
C  Conduct an audit
Incorrect. As they pertain to procurements, audits are a structured review of the procurement process. According to the scenario, you are concerned with the work in progress carried out by the 
vendor rather than with how well the procurement process has been managed on your project.
D  Resort to alternative dispute resolution (ADR)
Incorrect. ADR is aimed to address contested changes on projects where the buyer and seller cannot reach an agreement on compensation for the change or cannot agree that a change has 
occurred. Based on the scenario described, resorting to ADR is premature at this point.

Question 127 
Hint: What conflict resolution technique usually results in a win-win situation for the involved parties?
Correct Answer: B
Explanation:
The project manager is using the force/direct conflict resolution technique, which involves pushing one's viewpoint at the expense of others and offering only a win-lose solution. While 
force/direct is a legitimate conflict resolution technique, it should be used only when other conflict resolution techniques fail or when the situation warrants this approach. The scenario 
described in the question does not suggest that other conflict resolution techniques have been used or that the situation is so acute that the project manager was left with no option except to 
use the force/direct technique. Since it appears the project manager did have other options, she should have pursued a win-win outcome, which the collaborative/problem-solving technique 
often creates. Discussing the stakeholder's idea with other stakeholders is the only conflict resolution technique offering the possibility of a win-win situation, and therefore is the best answer to 
the question asked.
Details for Each Option:
A  No. The project manager has the formal authority to make the final decision.
Incorrect. Unless the situation is an emergency (which is not the case in the scenario described), the project manager should not push her viewpoint onto others from a stance of power, known 
as a force/direct conflict resolution technique. This approach usually ends with a win-lose situation and therefore is not the best course of action in this situation. The project manager should 
have responded differently.
B  Yes. The project manager should have discussed the idea with other stakeholders.
Correct. The project manager should have used a collaborative/problem-solving approach to address the conflict, such as discussing the idea with other project stakeholders and/or the team. 
Such a discussion would have allowed both sides to incorporate multiple viewpoints and insights from differing perspectives and hopefully lead to a win-win outcome with consensus and 
commitment
C  No. The project manager demonstrated the culture in which the company works.
Incorrect. The project manager may well have been demonstrating the culture of the company (raising another issue, which is outside the scope of this question) but using a force/direct 
technique is still not the best way to resolve a conflict.
D  Yes. The project manager should have compromised with the stakeholder.
Incorrect. Compromising often leads to a lose-lose outcome because this technique searches for a resolution to the conflict in order to appease both parties, but the decision may not be the best 
for the project. While compromising could have been a better approach than forcing, a collaborative/problem-solving approach is preferred. Therefore, this answer is not the best choice.

Question 128 
Hint: What is the backlog of an agile project comprised of?
Correct Answer: A
Explanation:
A software development project that will use an iterative and incremental approach to produce its deliverables implies the project will be using agile methods and artifacts. The reason for 
selecting an iterative and incremental approach in the first place is typically the extent to which project requirements are known (unknown) upfront. When there is ambiguity surrounding 
requirements in a project's early stages, teams can take high-level themes or epics provided to them by the customer or product owner and decompose them into features. Further 
decomposition may lead to user stories and other items added to the backlog and prioritized for the nearest iteration (sprint). As the project unfolds, the team would take the next set of epics 
and apply the same decomposition process. The cycle repeats itself until all project objectives are met or if a decision to stop the project (for whatever reason) is made.
Details for Each Option:
A  Decomposing epics into features and further into user stories
Correct. The scenario describes a software development project that will use an iterative and incremental approach to produce project deliverables. This type of project would benefit from 
planning in which high-level themes (or epics) are decomposed into features, which are then further decomposed into user stories and other backlog items.
B  Outsourcing project planning to an external subject matter expert
Incorrect. There is nothing wrong with outsourcing project planning (or any other project activity) to an external vendor who specializes in planning. However, the question asks about a planning 
strategy that would work best for this project. There is not enough information in the scenario to determine if outsourcing planning will be the best strategy.
C  Breaking down high-level deliverables into work packages
Incorrect. Unlike an agile project implied by the scenario, predictive projects with most requirements known early in the project life cycle can rely on detailed up-front planning. It starts with 
breaking down high-level deliverables into more detailed scope elements and further decomposing them down to the work package level of the WBS.
D  Planning product scope and refraining from planning project scope
Incorrect. Product scope is the features and functions that characterize the product, service, or result. Project scope is the 'work' performed to deliver the product, service, or result with the 
specified features and functions. Only planning product scope without planning the work that should be performed to deliver the product will likely result in project failure.

Question 129 
Hint: "Done drift" is a phenomenon typically associated with adaptive projects that are forced to continuously change their goals due to the frequently changing market conditions. 
Correct Answer: D
Explanation:
In the scenario, the project operates in an uncertain and rapidly changing environment, and competitors releasing new products with features more advanced than those planned by the project. 
Such a project will often face a situation where the definition of a "good enough for release" goal may be subject to change. For example, if the project planned to release the product to the 
market within 12 months, but in the meanwhile, a competitor released a similar product with more advanced features, a decision of whether to release now with the current set of features or 
add features to be on par with the competitor and delay the release should be made. It is not uncommon that while the decision to add features and delay the release is made, another 
competitor releases an even more advanced product. When this happens, the performing organization will have to re-evaluate the situation and make the next decision accordingly. This can go 
on and on forever, which is why in the scenario, the project manager is concerned that the project is in danger due to "done drift". Therefore, of the choices provided, whether to release the 
product as-is or continue updating the features prior to launch is the decision that the project manager (and the performing organization) will have to make, making that choice the best answer 
to the question
asked.
Details for Each Option:
A  How to keep the team motivated despite more advanced features developed by competitors
Incorrect. It is possible that in the uncertain and rapidly changing environment and stiff competition described by the scenario, the team's motivation may suffer. However, there is nothing In the 
question to suggest this is the case. Rather, the question focuses on the project manager's concern with "done drift", which is the moving target of completion.
B  When to switch from the adaptive to predictive development approach to prevent further changes
Incorrect. The scenario implies the project is carried out using the adaptive development approach. In the uncertain and rapidly changing environment, switching from the adaptive to predictive 
approach to prevent further changes would do more harm than good to the project and even further hinder the project's ability to respond to market conditions. 
C  What to do with the knowledge gained during the sprint retrospective meetings
Incorrect. A sprint retrospective is a meeting where participants explore their work and results to improve both process and product. Nothing in the scenario suggests that there is uncertainty 
surrounding the knowledge gained during retrospectives. The knowledge gained at the sprint retrospective should be applied to future sprints, releases, and projects. 
D  Whether to release the product as-is or continue updating the features prior to launch
Correct. "Done drift" refers to the situation in which the project is forced to continuously change its objectives due to the frequently changing market conditions. When this happens, the main 
concem is whether to release the product as-is or continue updating the features prior to launch, making this choice the best answer to the question asked

Correct. A CPI less than 1.0 indicates that more money was spent than planned for project work completed at this point, meaning the project is over budget. An SPI greater than 1.0 indicates that 
more project work was completed than planned at this point, meaning the project is ahead of schedule.
B
Under budget and behind schedule
Incorrect. A CPI of less than 1.0 indicates that the project is over budget. Therefore, this answer choice can be eliminated.
C
Over budget and behind schedule
Incorrect. An SPI of greater than 1.0 indicates that the project is ahead of schedule, so this is not a correct answer.
D
Under budget and ahead of schedule
Incorrect. A CPI of less than 1.0 indicates that the project is over budget, and an SPI of greater than 1.0 indicates that the project is ahead of schedule. Therefore, this answer choice is incorrect.

Question 131
Hint: Which tailoring consideration may have led you, as the project manager, to select a different development approach? 
Correct Answer: B
Explanation:
The question describes a situation where the client is continually changing the project requirements as the product under development evolves. This situation is driving the client to submit 
change requests, which must be reviewed by the change control board (CCB). Projects, where the product under development is expected to evolve throughout the project, can be said to have 
unstable requirements. The stability of requirements should be considered to determine the appropriate development approach. In this case, it is apparent that the strict change control 
processes and procedures of a traditional waterfall approach are not well suited to the needs of the client who is forced to submit change requests as the product changes and evolves. In this 
circumstance, an agile approach may have been more appropriate for the project. An agile approach welcomes change and harnesses it for the customer's benefit. Had you, as the project 
manager, considered the stability (or, in this case, instability) of the product requirements, you may have selected an approach more appropriate for the project. For example, the project, at a 
high level, could have still been lead using waterfall, but the actual development of the product performed by the team could have been carried out using agile, thus making the whole project 
hybrid.
Note, the development approach is also a tailoring consideration for the scope management processes, but it was not offered as an answer choice. Therefore, of the available options, the 
stability of requirements is the best answer to the question asked.
Details for Each Option:
A  Diversity
Incorrect. The diverse background of the team is an important consideration in resource management, but it is not very relevant to controlling scope. Additionally, there is no Information 
presented by the question to suggest that a diversity issue exists in the project.
B  Stability of requirements
Correct. The stability of requirements should be considered to determine the appropriate development approach. In this case, it is apparent that the change control requirements of a traditional 
waterfall approach are not well suited to the needs of the cilent who is forced to submit change requests as the product changes and evolves.
C  Physical location
Incorrect. Physical location is a tailoring consideration associated with the resource management processes rather than the scope management processes. Additionally, the physical location of 
team members and resources is not likely to create the problem of excessive change requests.
D  Validation and control
Incorrect. There is no indication from the question of an issue with proper validation and control procedures. The use of a change control board (CCB) in a waterfall approach is an appropriate 
method of controlling the project's scope. In this case, the problem involves the selected development approach driving excessive change requests rather than how those change requests are 
being processed.

Question 132 
Hint: You, as the project manager, are developing the project charter.
Correct Answer: B 
Explanation:
The scenario describes a project manager who is developing a draft of the project charter, implying the Develop Project Charter process is carried out. One of the typical activities performed 
while developing the charter is to review organizational process assets (OPAS), which may influence this process. One of the OPAS is the project governance framework which often provides 
information about the governance functions, processes, that are important when making decisions that are relevant to the project charter.
One may argue that a stakeholder register can be created at the same time the project charter is developed and approved. While it's true, the question is asking to select the answer choice that 
represents an action performed 'during this process'. Since the scenario describes the Develop Project Charter process, any action that is associated with 'this process' would be a better option 
than an action associated with 'another process', even if that process can be done in parallel with the one described in the scenario. Therefore, as we always recommend selecting the best 
answer of those provided, studying the governance functions and processes to provide guidance and decision making is a better answer choice than identifying stakeholders and preparing the 
stakeholder register since the former is associated with the inputs to the Develop Project Charter process while the latter is not even part of this process.
Details for Each Option:
A  Identify stakeholders and prepare the stakeholder register
Incorrect. The question implies that you, as the project manager, are conducting the Develop Project Charter process. The stakeholder register is developed during the Identify Stakeholders 
process and not the Develop Project Charter process.
B  Study the governance functions and processes to provide guidance and decision making
Correct. The project governance framework is part of the organizational process assets (OPA), which serve as an input into the Develop Project Charter process.
C  Update the business documents to correct any errors
Incorrect. The project manager may make recommendations but does not update or modify the business documents since they are not project documents.
D  Review the benefits management plan
Incorrect. The benefits management plan and business case comprise the business documents, and the question states that these documents have already been reviewed.

Question 133 
Hint: One of the answer choices is done during the Monitoring and Controlling Process Group and not during the Close Project or Phase process. 
Correct Answer: A
Explanation:
The scenario implies the project manager is performing the Close Project or Phase process which involves finalizing all activities for the project or phase. During this process information is 
archived, organizational resources are released, and the final deliverable is transferred to operations for ongoing support and maintenance. The administrative closure of a project includes the 
activities necessary to satisfy the completion or exit criteria for the project. All of the answer choices except closing seller contracts are involved in the administrative closure of a project. Closing 
seller contracts is performed during the Control Procurements process, not Close Project or Phase. Since the question asks which answer is 'not' included in the administrative closure of a 
project, closing the seller contracts is the correct answer.
Details for Each Option:
A Closing seller contracts
Correct. Closing seller contracts is performed during the Control Procurements process, not as part of the Close Project or Phase process, making this choice the correct answer. 
B Handing over the project deliverables to operations
Incorrect. Once delivered by a project, the final deliverable may be handed over to a different group or organization that will support, operate, and maintain it throughout its lifecycle. This 
process is included in the administrative closure of a project and therefore is an incorrect answer.
C Transferring the knowledge gained to the lessons learned repository
Incorrect. Lessons learned and knowledge gained throughout the project are gathered and transferred to the lessons learned repository at the end of a project and are therefore part of the Close 
Project or Phase process.
D Measuring stakeholder satisfaction
Incorrect. Soliciting feedback from stakeholders about both the project and the product is highly beneficial to a project manager and is an important part of project closure. Therefore, this answer 
is incorrect.

Question 134 
Hint: How might you evaluate the new developer's current skill set? 
Correct Answer: A 
Explanation:
Individual and team assessments are tools that may be useful in the Develop Team process. Individual and team assessment tools give the project manager and the project team insight into areas 
of strengths and weaknesses. These tools help project managers assess team members' preferences, aspirations, how they process and organize information, how they make decisions, and how 
they interact with people. Various tools are available such as attitudinal surveys, specific assessments, structured interviews, ability tests, and focus groups. An ability test would provide an 
assessment of the new developer's existing competencies in order to determine what, if any, gaps in skill set exist and how they might be addressed. The incorrect answer choices represent 
actions which are premature without understanding the new developer's existing competencies. Of the available options, providing the new developer with an ability test to evaluate the 
developer's existing competencies is what you, as the project manager should do first.
Details for Each Option:
A  Provide the new developer with an ability test
Correct. An ability test would provide an assessment of the new developer's existing competencies in order to determine what, if any, gaps in skill set exist and how they might be addressed.
B  Introduce the new developer to the project sponsor
Incorrect. It is unlikely that introducing the new developer to the project sponsor should be your first step in this situation. Bringing the new developer up to speed to perform the project work is 
more important. The developer's skills should be assessed to understand what training, if any, is required.
C  Schedule training for the new developer
Incorrect. The new developer may or may not need additional training for the current project. You, as the project manager, should perform an individual assessment of the new developers 
existing skillset to determine if training is necessary, and, if so, which training options would be the most beneficial in closing any knowledge gaps.
D  Assign the developer the next user story in the backlog
Incorrect. The new developer may or may not have the required competencies to complete the next user story successfully. You, as the project manager, should first gain an
understanding of the new developer's skill set to determine if the next user story is an appropriate assignment for the developer. Failing to take this step, may set the new developer up for 
failure.

Question 135 
Hint: How do agile practitioners maximize the work not done?
Correct Answer: A 
Explanation:
As a servant leader, an agile project manager should pave the way for the project team to do their best work. Whenever possible, the agile project manager should focus on eliminating any non- 
value added work. However, sometimes, activities such as compliance reporting are just a requirement that cannot be eliminated. In such hybrid environments, working with the auditors to 
streamline the process and eliminate any unnecessary work would minimize the non-value added activities in order to maximize the delivery of value while still addressing and balancing the 
compliance needs.
Details for Each Option:
A  Work with the auditors to streamline the process
Correct. Working with the auditors to streamline the process and eliminate any unnecessary work would minimize the non-value added activities in order to maximize the delivery of value. 
B  Task one of the team members to complete the compliance reporting
Incorrect. Agile leaders should avoid assigning non-value added tasks to the team members. When possible, the developers on the project team should be focused on delivering value rather than 
performing overhead tasks.
C  Transfer the responsibility of compliance reporting to the legal department
Incorrect. It is unlikely that a project manager would have the authority to assign responsibility for compliance report to another department. Additionally, It is not likely that the legal department 
would have sufficient insight into the project to complete the compliance reporting for the project.
D  Avoid agile as it not suitable for projects that operate in a regulatory environment
Incorrect. Agile best practices stress the importance of maximizing the work not done. However, sometimes, activities that do not add value to the project are still required. In cases where non-
value added activities are required, the agile project manager should work to eliminate any unnecessary work and streamline the process as much as possible. An organization should not avoid 
agile due to compliance reporting.

Question 136 
Hint:  What is the proper escalation path in this scenario?
Correct Answer: A
Explanation:
Project team members are initially responsible for resolving their own conflicts. If the conflict escalates, the project manager should help facilitate a satisfactory resolution. If the disruptive 
conflict persists, formal procedures may be used, including disciplinary action. In this scenario, the project manager has already given the team members the opportunity to resolve their own 
issues and attempted to facilitate a resolution. The project manager should not allow conflict to put the success of the project at risk. The project manager should use formal procedures including 
disciplinary actions to resolve the issue.
Details for Each Option:
A  Use formal procedures including disciplinary actions
Correct. Formal procedures may be used including disciplinary actions in order to prevent the project from being put at risk.
B  Allow the team members to resolve their differences on their own
Incorrect. The first step is to allow the team members to resolve the conflict on their own. However, that has failed to resolve the issue, and the project is at risk.
C  Facilitate another meeting between the two team members
Incorrect. The second step is for the project manager to facilitate a resolution between the parties. However, that has failed to resolve the issue, and the project is at risk. 
D  Request that the other project team members intercede as a form of peer pressure
Incorrect. Conflict should be addressed privately and confidentially. It is inappropriate to involve the other team members in conflict resolution.

Question 137 
Hint:  Which role has direct responsibility for projects, programs, and operations?
Correct Answer: A
Explanation:
The question describes a situation where a problem needs to be addressed by someone that is responsible for projects, programs, and operations being managed as a group. A portfolio is a 
collection of projects, programs, and operations managed as a group to achieve strategic objectives. Only a portfolio manager has direct responsibility for projects, programs, and operations. 
Therefore, discussing the problem with the portfolio manager is the best course of action in this scenario.
Details for Each Option:
A  Discuss the problem with the portfolio manager
Correct. The question suggests that the conflict needs to be addressed by someone that is responsible for projects, programs, and operations. Only a portfolio manager has direct responsibility 
for all three of these areas.
B  Escalate the issue to the operations manager
Incorrect. Based on the scenario, the conflict has reached an impasse, which implies that further discussion with the operations manager will not resolve the issue. Additionally, the question 
indicates that the conflict will need to be escalated to someone with authority over projects and operations, and an operations manager is not likely to have authority for project execution.
C  Raise the issue with the other project manager
Incorrect. The question states that the conflict is at an impasse, which suggests that further discussion with the other project manager is futile. Additionally, the question implies that the issue 
needs to be escalated to someone with authority over projects, programs, and operations being managed as a group. A project manager is not likely to oversee programs and operations as part 
of their regular duties.
D  Request help from the project management office
Incorrect. The project management office (PMO) is a management structure that standardizes the project-related governance processes and facilitates the sharing of resources, methodologies, 
tools, and techniques. While the PMO may help (depending on its role in the organization) with settling the conflict between the projects, the PMO would unlikely have the authority over 
operations.

Question 138 
Hint: What must the project manager do first to control her own emotions?
Correct Answer: B 
Explanation:
Emotional intelligence is the ability to identify, assess, and manage the personal emotions of oneself and other people, as well as the collective emotions of groups of people. The first step in 
developing emotional intelligence is self-awareness, which can then lead to self-management. Only when the project manager learns to exercise self-control as part of self-management will she 
be able to deal with the emotions and behaviors of others effectively. Since the scenario describes a project manager who has difficulty controlling her own temper, the best advice you can give 
her is to develop her emotional intelligence skills.
Details for Each Option:
A  Improve leadership skills
Incorrect. Leadership is the ability to lead a team and inspire them to do their jobs well. There is not enough information in the question to determine if the team member is not doing their job 
well requiring the mentee to improve her leadership skills. Based on the scenario described, the issue is related to the self-control of the mentee rather than her leadership skills. It is unlikely that 
a project manager can be a good leader without being able to control her own emotions.
B  Develop emotional intelligence
Correct. In the scenario described, your mentee is having troubles controlling her temper. Emotional intelligence is the ability to identify, assess, and manage the personal emotions of oneself 
and other people, as well as the collective emotions of groups of people. Emotional Intelligence skills can be taught and developed. You, as a mentor, can help your mentee in achieving this goal. 
Therefore, of the choices provided, the best advice you can give her is to develop her emotional Intelligence.
C  Study conflict management
Incorrect. Conflict management may seem like a plausible answer, but it is not the best answer among the choices given. Conflict management skills will certainly be beneficial in dealing with 
conflict among the team members. However, the new project manager must first develop self-awareness of how her own behavior is contributing to the problem. The project manager must first 
control her own emotions before coaching others on controlling theirs.
D  Introduce recognition and rewards
Incorrect. Recognition and rewards are used to reinforce desired behavior among the project team members. However, the scenario does not describe any behavior that should be reinforced. 
Rather, the team member who participates in the shouting matches described by the scenario, regardless of who triggers them, demonstrates behavior that is unlikely to meet standards of 
recognition and rewards.

Question 139 
Hint: During which agile ceremony does the project team discuss what went well and what improvements can be made?
Correct Answer: C 
Explanation:
The question is being asked from an agile perspective. Iteration (or sprint) planning, reviews, and retrospectives are all ceremonies which are associated with an agile framework. The iteration 
retrospective is a specialized meeting that is held by the project team at the end of an iteration. The purpose of the meeting is to discuss what went well during the iteration as well as what 
improvements can be made for future iterations. Of the available choices, the iteration retrospective is the best way to capture and analyze lessons learned during the project.
Details for Each Option:
A Perform a sprint review
Incorrect. An iteration (or sprint) review is a meeting where the project team demonstrates the product increment that has been built during the iteration in order to get feedback from 
stakeholders and gain the approval of the product owner. The iteration review is not a meeting that is focused on process improvement.
B Schedule a sprint planning meeting
Incorrect. A sprint planning meeting is a meeting where the project team determines what will be accomplished during the upcoming sprint (iteration) and how the results will be achieved. 
Process improvement is not a subject of the sprint planning meeting.
C Conduct an iteration retrospective
Correct. An iteration retrospective is a specialized meeting that is held by the project team at the end of an iteration. The purpose of the meeting is to discuss what went well during the iteration 
as well as what improvements can be made for future iterations. In other words, based on the lessons learned so far in the project, the team tries to improve the process going forward which is 
what was asked by the question, making this choice the best answer of those provided.
D Lessons learned are not utilized on agile projects
Incorrect. Lessons learned or knowledge gained should be used for continuous improvement on all projects regardless of the framework that is being employed. Without the benefit of learning 
from past experience, an organization will likely experience the same problems on a recurring basis.

Question 140 
Hint: What role typically approves or rejects the product increment from a sprint?
Correct Answer: B 
Explanation:
The scenario describes a hybrid project where the scope is managed using a predictive project management approach (scope baseline), while the procurement portion of work is outsourced to a 
vendor who will use agile methods to develop the scope specified in the SOW. An agile framework is typically used when the project scope is not well understood at the start of the project 
(which is the case in the scenario described) and is progressively elaborated throughout project execution. This situation creates special considerations when contracting with a vendor to supply 
developers. One method of addressing the issue is to use contract terms that include fixed-price increments. With this approach, the scope is decomposed into microdeliverables, such as user 
stories, and the vendor will be paid a fixed price for each of these microdeliverables.
In this scenario, the development team will complete the user stories determined during sprint planning. At the end of the sprint, during the sprint review, the development team will 
demonstrate the product increment that was developed during the sprint to the product owner and other relevant stakeholders. The product owner then has the authority and responsibility for 
approving or rejecting the deliverables.
Details for Each Option:
A  Wait until the team completes the development of all user stories specified in the SOW
Incorrect. With a contract featuring fixed-price increments, the project scope (or the scope specified in the SOW in the scenario described) can be decomposed into fixed-price microdeliverables, 
such as user stories. With this type of contract, there is no reason nor is this appropriate per agile best practices to wait until the entire project scope has been completed before approving the 
deliverables.
B  Request the product owner to approve or reject user stories during a sprint review
Correct. During a sprint review, the development team demonstrates the product increment that was developed during the sprint. The product owner then has the responsibility for approving or 
rejecting the deliverables.
C  Validate the user stories as soon as they are completed at any point during a sprint
Incorrect. The use of sprints creates a cadence of predictable, timeboxed pre-agreed, consistent duration that aids with scheduling. Validating the user stories as soon as they are completed at 
any point in a sprint before the timebox is over, would interfere with the team's work, break the cadence, and negatively affect the project schedule, and may have other unintended 
consequences.
D  Conduct a procurement audit with the vendor each time a sprint retrospective is held
Incorrect. A procurement audit is a structured review of the procurement process between the buyer and seller (vendor). The emphasis is on the process of procurement rather than the 
deliverables produced by the vendor. Sprint retrospectives, on the other hand, are aimed to review the process the development team uses to carry out their work rather than review the 
procurement process.

Question 141 
Hint: Proactive planning should consider risk mitigation and cost control strategies.
Correct Answer: B
Explanation:
Predictive analysis and fixed-price contracts reduce future budget risks and provide cost certainty, making them effective proactive measures.
The project manager is dealing with fluctuating material costs in a multi-phase project, which means the challenge is ongoing and not just a one-time issue. This cost volatility can disrupt budget 
planning, leading to potential overruns. The project manager must proactively implement a measure that minimizes the financial impact in future phases.
Using predictive analysis to forecast future cost variations and negotiate fixed-price contracts. This is the best proactive approach because it addresses the issue by using data-driven forecasting 
(predictive analysis) to estimate future cost fluctuations. Locking in fixed-price contracts, ensuring cost certainty and reducing exposure to price volatility. Mitigating financial risks, allowing better 
budget planning and resource allocation. By leveraging predictive analysis, the project team can analyze historical price trends, market conditions, inflation rates, and supply chain factors to 
anticipate future fluctuations. This information allows them to negotiate fixed-price contracts with suppliers, ensuring cost stability for the remaining project phases.
Details for Each Option:
A  Increase contingency reserves for all future phases.
Incorrect. Increasing reserves may not address the root cause of fluctuations. While increasing reserves might provide a temporary buffer, it does not address the root cause of cost fluctuations. 
Contingency reserves are meant for unexpected risks, not ongoing, predictable cost variations.
B  Use predictive analysis to forecast future cost variations and negotiate fixed-price contracts.
Correct. Forecasting and negotiating fixed prices mitigate risks effectively. This approach prevents cost overruns and enables better budget management while maintaining project timelines.
C  Request a larger overall budget to account for uncertainties.
Incorrect. Requesting more funds may not be feasible without clear justification. Budget increases require justification-stakeholders or sponsors won't approve additional funding without solid 
reasoning. It is a reactive rather than proactive approach and does not control costs, only shifts the burden to a larger budget.
D  Delay purchasing materials until costs stabilize.
Incorrect. Delaying purchases risks schedule slippage and missed opportunities. Waiting for prices to stabilize is risky, as prices may continue fluctuating unpredictably. Delaying material 
purchases can lead to schedule slippage, impacting project deadlines. Many suppliers increase prices over time rather than decreasing them, making delays counterproductive.

Question 142 
Hint: This technique might be referred to as a project premortem.
Correct Answer: B 
Explanation:
"Remember the future" is a collaboration game where stakeholders are asked to envision the future state of the project after completion. This technique is particularly helpful in drawing out 
requirements and gaining consensus on the project vision. When this technique is applied to the failure of a project (sometimes referred to as a project premortem), it allows stakeholders to 
envision and capture various ways that the project could fail. Applying this technique to regulatory compliance would aid in providing a shared vision for the consequences of non-compliance. 
Understanding the consequences of non-compliance will help the stakeholders include appropriate regulatory (and other) compliance requirements in the project vision.
Details for Each Option:
A  Facilitate a project post-mortem
Incorrect. A project post-mortem (also known as a project retrospective) occurs at the end of the project. Therefore, this activity will not be able to influence the project requirements. 
B  Play a session of "remember the future"
Correct. "Remember the future" is a collaborative game to aid in the development of the project vision. When this technique is applied to the failure of a project (sometimes referred to as a 
project premortem), it allows stakeholders to envision and capture various ways that the project could fail.
C  Lead a round of planning poker
Incorrect. Planning Poker is a collaborative estimating and planning technique that is used to estimate user story size. This technique would not likely be used to analyze the consequences of non-
compliance.
D  Conduct a t-shirt sizing exercise
Incorrect. A t-shirt sizing exercise is a relative sizing technique for gaining a high-level estimate for items in the product backlog. This technique would not be particularly useful for analyzing the 
consequences of non-compliance.

Question 143 
Hint: What extreme Programming (XP) practice might achieve the project leader's objective?
Correct Answer: D 
Explanation:
Successful project leaders build quality into processes and deliverables. This question asks for a best practice in which potential software defects can be identified and corrected while the code is 
still being written. Any form of testing, by definition, is reactive and would occur once some code has already been written. However, the practice of pair programming from the extreme 
Programming method is proactive and has the advantage of potentially discovering defects and rectifying them as the code is being written. With pair programming, two developers work in 
tandem, with one developer writing the code while the other reviewing the code as it is written. The developers then switch roles frequently. While various quality assurance methods would be 
employed with a project such as the one described in this scenario, of the available choices, only pair programming meets the project leader's objective.
Details for Each Option:
A  Include a user story for smoke testing in every sprint
Incorrect. Smoke testing is the process of using lightweight tests to ensure that the most important functions of the software work as intended. While smoke testing might be a good quality 
assurance practice, any form of testing would occur after the software code has been written rather than while it is being written, as asked by the question.
B  Do not allow changes after the system design is approved
Incorrect. The scenario indicates that an agile framework is being employed for this project. Agile projects welcome change and harness it for the customer's competitive advantage. Not allowing 
changes, as suggested by this answer choice, would go against the agile best principles and likely do more harm than good for the project and customer.
C  Employ continuous integration of product increments
Incorrect. Continuous integration refers to frequent incorporation of work into the whole and testing it to determine if the entire product still works as intended. While this practice may help 
detect defects early in the project, integration cannot happen before the code is written. The question is looking for a way to build quality into code as it's being written.
D  Request that developers work in pairs while creating software
Correct. This answer choice implies the use of pair programming, a practice in which two developers work side-by-side coding the product. One developer writes code while another reviews it as 
it is written. In this way, defects can be identified and corrected as the software is being developed, making this choice the best answer to the question asked.

Question 144 
Hint:  Monitoring and feedback strengthen adherence to rules.
Correct Answer: A
Explanation:
Ensuring adherence to ground rules requires proactive monitoring and consistent feedback. By conducting periodic assessments, the project manager reinforces expectations and provides 
guidance on areas of improvement. This approach encourages accountability and strengthens team discipline. Without active reinforcement, ground rules may be ignored over time, leading to 
inefficiencies and team conflicts.
Details for Each Option:
A  Conduct periodic assessments and provide feedback on adherence to ground rules.
Correct. Regular assessments and feedback reinforce adherence to ground rules, ensuring alignment with project expectations. Open discussions about compliance help resolve issues before 
they escalate.
B  Assume team members will naturally adhere once the rules are set.
Incorrect. Simply assuming compliance is ineffective. Team members may unintentionally deviate from the rules without regular reinforcement. Proactive engagement is necessary to maintain 
discipline.
C  Only address violations when team performance is negatively impacted.
Incorrect. Addressing violations only when they significantly impact performance is reactive. A proactive approach prevents minor issues from escalating into major disruptions.
D  Replace team members who fail to comply with ground rules.
Incorrect. Removing team members is an extreme measure that could demoralize the team. Instead, coaching and constructive feedback should be the first steps to address non- compliance.

Question 145 
Hint: Which vendor provides the highest EMV?
Correct Answer: B
Explanation:
The expected monetary value (EMV) technique is one that calculates the combined probability and impact values of a decision or a solution. This question requires a simple multiplication of the 
profit anticipated from a vendor by the probability of the vendor's success. Selecting Vendor 2 is the correct answer because they provide a solution with the highest EMV.
Details for Each Option:
A
Vendor 1 with an 80% probability of success and profit of $20,000
Incorrect. Vendor 1's solution is calculated as 0.80 x $20,000 = $16,000, which is not the highest EMV possible of the answer choices given.
B
Vendor 2 with a 90% probability of success and profit of $19,000
Correct. Vendor 2's solution is calculated as 0.90 x $19,000 = $17,100, which represents the highest profit to the project from the answer choices given. 
C
Vendor 3 with a 75% probability of success and profit of $18,000
Incorrect. Vendor 3's solution is calculated as 0.75 x $18,000 = $13,500, which is not the highest EMV possible of the answer choices given.
D
Vendor 4 with an 85% probability of success and profit of $20,000

Agile best practices promote transparency. Displaying burndown charts and other relevant project information in a highly visible location promotes transparency as current information regarding 
project status is readily available to everyone. All of the answer choices represent actions that should be taken by the project manager. The PMP aspirant should select the 'best' answer among 
the available options. With the project team and stakeholders co-located at the corporate office, posting the project status in a highly visible location will make current information readily 
available to everyone. Note that the incorrect answer choices all represent an action that must be taken by the stakeholders in order to retrieve the information rather than having the 
information proactively presented to them. The correct answer choice describes an agile best practice. Therefore, of the available options, displaying burndown charts and other relevant project

Incorrect. Holding monthly project status meetings is a good idea. However, the project status will change daily during project execution. A monthly meeting will only provide a snapshot of the 
project status. To promote transparency as asked by the question, it is better to make current information readily available.
B  Post burndown charts and other project status documents to the company's intranet site
Incorrect. The project manager probably should post any relevant project status documents to the company's intranet site. However, this action requires the project team and stakeholders to 
proactively access the information rather than having the information readily available to them.
C  Share the appropriate information whenever requested by stakeholders
Incorrect. The project manager should share any relevant information upon request. However, requiring stakeholders to seek out the information they need is not the best way to keep 
stakeholders informed and promote transparency.
D  Display bumdown charts and other relevant project artifacts in a highly visible location
Correct. Agile best practices encourage transparency. Displaying burndown charts and other relevant project information in a highly visible location promotes transparency as the information 
readily available to everyone.

Question 147 
Hint: Divide the story points remaining by the average velocity.
Correct Answer: D 
Explanation:
The way to forecast velocity is to run an iteration (or two, or three) and then calculate the average velocity based on the story points completed during each of the iterations. In this situation, the 
project team's current average velocity is 30 story points. In this scenario, to calculate the number of iterations required to complete the remaining portion of the project, the number of story 
points remaining (292 story points) needs to be divided by the average velocity (30 story points). 292 divided by 30 results in 9.74 iterations. Therefore, at the current velocity, it should take 
another 10 iterations to complete the project.
Please note, the result should be rounded to 10, not because of the math rules, but rather because there is no such thing as half iteration, or quarter iteration (or any other portion of iteration). 
Therefore, even if the result were 9.1, the answer would be the same: it should take 10 iterations for the team to complete the project.
Details for Each Option:
A  7 iterations
Incorrect. If the average velocity for the team is 30 story points, then, if the current velocity is maintained, the team would only be able to complete 210 (the product of 7 and 30) of the 
remaining 292 story points after the next 7 Iterations.
B  8 iterations
Incorrect. The scenario indicates that the average velocity for the team stands at 30 story points. At the current velocity of 30 story points, the team could expect to complete 240 (the product of 
8 and 30) story points of the remaining 292 after 8 additional iterations. The team would need to experience a significant increase in velocity to complete the project in only 8 Iterations, and 
there is no information presented that would suggest that the velocity might increase for the remainder of the project.
C  9 iterations
Incorrect. The average velocity of the team is stated at 30 story points. At the current velocity, the team can expect to complete 30 story points for each of the remaining iterations. Thus, 
Iterations should yield 270 completed story points (the product of 9 and 30). Therefore, unless the team experiences an increase in velocity, an additional iteration will be necessary to complete 
the remaining 22 story points.
D  10 iterations
Correct. To calculate the number of iterations required to complete the remaining portion of the project, one should divide the number of story points remaining, 292, by the average velocity of 
30 story points. 292 divided by 30 results in 9.74 iterations. Therefore, at the current velocity, it should take another 10 iterations to complete the project

Question 148 
Hint: How might you determine which obstacle to address first?
Correct Answer: B 
Explanation:
The question states that the team is facing various impediments resulting in schedule delays. The project manager should work with the team to ensure that the obstacles are cleared as 
efficiently and effectively as possible so the development can get back to work on the project's deliverables. However, before the project manager can work on removing the blockers, the 
impediments should first be analyzed and prioritized. For example, it is possible that one impediment is currently blocking the entire team, and others might only be affecting individual team 
members. Thus, it will be important to address the most severe and time-critical impediments first. Therefore, of the available options, the project manager should first analyze and prioritize the 
blockers.
Note, the scenario describes a project in which the project schedule is managed using the traditional/predictive project management approach (the schedule baseline is in jeopardy") while the 
work is carried out using the Scrum framework, which is one of the agile methods ("a project manager is conducting a daily standup"). This means the project as a whole is managed in a hybrid 
way. While this information does not change the correct answer, it is important to understand that projects can be managed using various approaches, including predictive (sometimes called 
traditional or waterfall), agile, or hybrid which is a combination of both.
Details for Each Option:
A  Attempt to resolve the problems during the meeting
Incorrect. While it is essential to remove the blockers as quickly as possible, the scenario indicates that a dally standup meeting is underway. The dally standup is a meeting in which Impediments 
are identified. However, this meeting is not intended to find solutions for the impediments.
B  Analyze and prioritize the blockers
Correct. The various impediments described in the scenario should first be analyzed and prioritized in order to determine the most efficient and effective path for clearing them. 
C  Assign the team to work on another project in the meanwhile
Incorrect. Reassigning the team to another project is an overreaction. If the blockers are removed quickly, the team can continue working on the existing project. The impediments should first be 
analyzed before a decision to move the team to another project (if at all) is made.
D  Escalate the issue to the project sponsor
Incorrect. The impediments identified in this scenario may or may not need to be escalated to the project sponsor. There is not enough information to make that determination. The project 
manager should first analyze the blockers to determine if escalation is even warranted.

Question 149 
Hint: Which information serves as input or is a tool and technique in the plan stakeholder engagement process? Which information is likely to be found elsewhere? 
Correct Answer: B,D,E,F
Explanation:
When a stakeholder leaves a project or when a new stakeholder joins the project, an iteration of the Identify Stakeholders process as well as the Plan Stakeholder Engagement process takes 
place. Meetings are an example of the tools and techniques that can be used as part of both processes. A meeting between the project manager and the new key stakeholder can take the form 
of an interview allowing both parties to get to know each other and set expectations for the project. The questions asked during the interview should be designed in a way that would help the 
project manager identify the inputs of the Plan Stakeholder Engagement process as it relates to this particular stakeholder. For example, stakeholder's risk appetites, stakeholder's communication 
preferences, lessons that the stakeholder has learned from past projects, level of stakeholder's support for the project are among the inputs that can be used by the project manager in the 
process of updating the stakeholder engagement plan.
Details for Each Option:
A  Have you ever managed a project before?
Incorrect. The new stakeholder joins the project to replace another stakeholder, not the project manager. Therefore, while the project management experience may come in handy, it is not 
required for and is unlikely to be a factor in updating the stakeholder engagement plan as requested by the scenario.
B  How much risk are you willing to take for an anticipated benefit?
Correct. Stakeholder risk appetites are among the enterprise environmental factors (EEFS) that can be used as an input to the Plan Stakeholder Engagement process implied by the scenario. Risk 
appetite is an important Input because it can have a direct impact on the risk management strategies applied throughout the course of the project.
C  What position did you hold in your previous company?
Incorrect. It is unlikely that the answer to this question will have a significant (if any) impact on the stakeholder engagement process implied by the scenario or would require an update to the 
stakeholder engagement plan. Therefore, this question can be considered Irrelevant.
D  What are your communication preferences?
Correct. Project Stakeholder Management and Project Communications Management are two Knowledge Areas that often intertwined. Understanding the communication requirements, needs, 
and preferences of a stakeholder can help plan effective communication with that stakeholder as well as help in proper stakeholder involvement in the project.
E  Do you have any lessons learned to share from your previous projects?
Correct. Lessons learned from previous projects are organizational process assets (OPAS) that serve as an input to the process of planning stakeholder engagement. Whether the new stakeholder 
comes from within the organization or outside of it, lessons learned are valuable assets that may help the current project team learn from others' mistakes.
F  Do you think it was the right thing to undertake the project?
Correct. By asking this question, the project manager can determine how much support and awareness for the project the stakeholder has. This kind of Information can be tracked in the 
stakeholder engagement assessment matrix, a key tool in carrying out the Plan Stakeholder Engagement process implied by the scenario.

Question 150 
Hint: Which answer choice represents a technique from eXtreme Programming (XP)?
Correct Answer: D
Explanation:
The scenario describes a hybrid project in which some of the elements are managed using a predictive/traditional project management approach (the schedule baseline, the Control Quality 
process, the dedicated QA department) while others are managed using agile (the product is developed over the course of several iterations). Pair programming is an agile software development 
technique from extreme Programming (XP) in which two developers work side-by-side in tandem at the same workstation. While one programmer writes the code, the other reviews the code as 
it is entered. The two then switch roles frequently. With pair programming, the feedback loop is immediate. If a developer enters a coding error, their partner has the opportunity to catch the 
error where it can be fixed immediately. Thus, of the available responses, pair programming offers the feedback loop with the shortest interval.
Details for Each Option:
A  Shorten the iteration length
Incorrect. While shortening the iteration length would allow the team to gain feedback from the QA department earlier in comparison to the current cadence, agile best practices discourage 
changing the iteration length in the middle of a project.
B  Reduce the size of the user stories
Incorrect. Since the testing is done at the end of each iteration, reducing the size of the user stories would not progress work items from development to testing quicker. The QA department 
would still have to wait until all the user stories in the iteration are completed whether the user stories are big, medium, or small. Additionally, it's up to the team, not the project manager, to 
determine whether a user story should be split.
C  Revise the schedule baseline
Incorrect. According to the scenario, there are already delays to the project schedule. Therefore, it is reasonable to assume that the schedule baseline will need to be revised. However, this 
action would not shorten the feedback loop, as requested by the question.
D  Suggest pair programming to the team
Correct. Pair programming is an agile software development technique in which two developers work side-by-side: one programmer writes the code, the other reviews the code as it is entered. 
In this manner, the feedback loop is immediate and is the shortest of any other available options.

Question 151 
Hint: Which project management approach combines elements of both the predictive and agile?
Correct Answer: C
Explanation:
Development approach is a component of the project management plan that describes, as the name implies, the approach selected for the development of the product, service, or result 
delivered by the project. Predictive, iterative, agile, or hybrid are examples of the development approach. The main differences between the various development approaches lie in the way 
requirements are defined and managed, project deliverables are produced, change is handled, risk and cost are controlled, and stakeholders are involved. The different development approaches 
can be visually displayed on what is called, the continuum of project life cycles. A predictive development approach is at one extreme of the continuum, while the agile approach is at the other 
end, with hybrid models being anywhere in between. The scenario describes a project in which requirements are elaborated at several intervals during delivery; the delivery is divided into 
subsets of the overall product; change is incorporated at periodic intervals; risk and cost are controlled by progressively elaborating the plans with new information; and, key stakeholders are 
regularly involved. These practices combine elements of both predictive and agile life cycles, making the whole development approach hybrid.
Note, the development approach is sometimes called the development life cycle.
Details for Each Option:
A  Agile
Incorrect. On agile projects, requirements are elaborated frequently during delivery, delivery occurs frequently with customer-valued subsets of the overall product, change is incorporated in 
real-time during delivery; risk and cost are controlled as requirements and constraints emerge; and, key stakeholders are continuously involved.
B  Predictive
Incorrect. On predictive projects, requirements are defined up-front before development begins; a single final product is delivered at the end of the project, change is constrained as much as 
possible; risk and cost are controlled by detailed planning; and, key stakeholders are involved at specific milestones.
C  Hybrid
Correct. On hybrid projects, requirements are elaborated at several intervals; delivery is divided into subsets of the overall product, change is incorporated at periodic intervals; risk and cost are 
controlled by progressively elaborating the plans with new information; and, key stakeholders are regularly involved. This is the exact match with the scenario described, making this choice the 
best answer to the question asked.
D  Periodic

Question 152 
Hint: What is the best way to enable change to achieve the envisioned future state?
Correct Answer: D 
Explanation:
Projects drive an organization from the current state to an envisioned future state. To be successful, project leaders must enable change to achieve the envisioned future state. In this scenario, an 
agile project is being undertaken to restructure an organization from a weak matrix to a project-oriented organizational type. This type of change will significantly impact stakeholders, including 
reporting relationships, the scope of authority, essential competencies, etc. Such a significant change will likely be met with resistance by some of those affected by the changes. As a result, 
stakeholder engagement will be an important aspect of the project to keep stakeholders informed, correct misinformation, and promote the benefits of the change to facilitate the transition.
Note, terms such as generalizing specialists, product owner, an adaptive approach, etc., used across the question are typically associated with software development (ar knowledge-intensive) 
projects. However, nothing prevents an organization from using agile methods to undertake other initiatives, such as organizational change, like the one described in the scenario. Obviously, on 
such a project, the specific tasks performed by the team members, the product owner, and other stakeholders would be different from the roles performed in a knowledge project. For example, 
instead of developing software, the team will likely develop processes and procedures for the change. However, the application of adaptive/agile project management best practices for the 
organizational change project would be similar to those applied to the software development project.
Details for Each Option:
A  Keep the project confidential until the effective date of the reorganization
Incorrect. Confidentiality might be important while such a project is at the ideation stage. However, stakeholders should be informed of the changes prior to the implementation date to promote 
transparency. Additionally, stakeholders should have the opportunity to provide their feedback and have their concerns addressed before the implementation.
B  Appoint a change control board to review and decide on changes
Incorrect. The scenario implies that an adaptive (agile) framework will be used for this project. Agile projects do not typically incorporate a formal change management process, nor do they use a 
change control board (CCB) to review and decide on changes. Rather, agile methodologies favor a collaborative approach to changes over strict change control.
C  Reassure the project managers that their scope of authority will not change
Incorrect. Project managers have little authority within a weak matrix organizational structure and much greater authority in a project-oriented organization. Therefore, the scope of their 
authority will change significantly. Reassuring the project managers that their scope of authority will not change would be irresponsible and misleading.
D  Incorporate stakeholder engagement and motivational approaches
Correct. Restructuring an organization from a weak matrix to a project-oriented organizational type will have a significant impact on various job roles and responsibilities. For the success of the 
project, the team will need to engage with affected stakeholders to address their concerns and focus on the benefits that will result from the change.

Question 153 
Hint: Hint: Which project lifecycle approach would best work?
Correct Answer: A 
Explanation:
The hybrid life cycle approach leverages the strengths of waterfall and agile methods. The waterfall approach ensures the hardware development is on schedule and meets all regulatory 
standards and clarity. The agile approach allows the software to adapt to changing requirements and user feedback through an incremental development delivery. This integrated strategy ensures 
that both components are developed efficiently, effectively, and cohesively, leading to a successful project outcome.
A strictly sequential approach does not allow for flexibility in accommodating the missing development provisions for the application. It may result in delays or difficulties in integrating new 
requirements as they emerge.
An adaptive approach may lack the structured planning and sequencing necessary for cohesive development across hardware and software components. Without a clear roadmap, the project 
may face coordination challenges and difficulties in effectively integrating the two aspects.
Segregating the project into distinct stages may delay integrating the hardware and software components. Without concurrent development and continuous integration, the project timeline may 
be jeopardized.
Details for Each Option:
A  Use a waterfall approach that meets the end date and regulatory standards and an adaptive methodology that addresses the missing development provisions and allows the team to 
incorporate user feedback iteratively.
Correct. The predictive nature of the waterfall approach ensures that the hardware development follows a structured plan, allowing the team to meet the target end date and comply with 
regulatory standards. The adaptive approach provides flexibility in accommodating unknown requirements, allowing the team to develop the software Iteratively and incorporate user feedback 
and evolving needs to ensure the application meets user expectations. This hybrid life cycle allows for efficient development and addressing specific needs to ensure project Success.
B  Create an approach ensuring the hardware and software follow a strict sequential development plan.
Incorrect. A strictly sequential approach does not provide flexibility or adaptability to accommodate changes or unknown requirements that may arise during the project. There is a risk of delays 
in integrating hardware and software components. This may result in coordination challenges and difficulties in ensuring that the final product effectively meets the project objectives
C  Create an adaptive approach that allows the team to iteratively develop the project's hardware and software to meet its fixed end date and regulatory standards.
Incorrect. An adaptive approach allows for iterative development, but it may not ensure the thorough documentation and testing required to meet stringent regulatory standard's for the medical 
device. Iterative development cycles may extend the project timeline, making meeting the fixed end date difficult.
D  Rely solely on a phased approach that will allow the PM to segment the project into distinct stages, allowing flexibility in adapting the application development process based on evolving user 
feedback.
Incorrect. Segregating the project into distinct stages may lead to delays or challenges in effectively Integrating the hardware and software components. This lack of concurrent development and 
continuous Integration may hinder the overall project progress and success. Relying solely on a phased approach will not incorporate the strengths of a hybrid approach to this type of project.

Question 154 
Hint: What are tools and techniques to resolve interpersonal and cultural conflicts?
Correct Answer: A,C,E
Explanation:
The scenario surrounds the Develop Team process. This process is aimed at improving competencies, team member interaction, and the overall team environment to enhance project 
performance. When a team composition changes, conflict is often inevitable, especially when it involves cultural aspects. A project manager has to demonstrate cultural sensitivity, display strong 
interpersonal skills, and lead by example. Focus groups, ground rules, and meetings (e.g., team-building activities) are among the tools and techniques that may help the project manager in 
reconciling cultural differences, resolving conflicts, and, eventually, improving the overall collaboration between the team members, thus resulting in better project outcomes.
Details for Each Option:
A  Focus groups
Correct. Focus groups are an example of individual and team assessment tools and techniques that can be used as part of the Develop Team process implied by the scenario. With this technique, 
information is collected in group interviews to receive insights on a particular topic. The outputs could help the project manager better understand the root causes of the conflicts in the team and 
find appropriate solutions.
B  Role definition
Incorrect. According to the scenario, role definition has already been done but did not prevent the lack of acceptance of cultural differences among the team members. The conflict is likely to 
have deeper underlying causes. A more personal approach is needed to address the situation.
C  Ground rules
Correct. Ground rules can be added to the team charter, helping to set clear guidelines for behavior, especially between new team members and within the team overall. Ground rules, as well as 
codes of conduct, are often proven as an effective tool for reconciling cultural differences in teams.
D  Ability tests
Incorrect. Ability tests are an example of individual and team assessment tools and techniques that can be used as part of the Develop Team process implied by the scenario. These tests, 
however, are primarily used to assess skills and knowledge of the team members rather than resolve the cultural differences within the team.
E  Meetings
Correct. A team-building activity can be an agenda item at a meeting, helping team members work together more effectively. Such a meeting could address the issues and conflicts in the team 
and collaboratively find solutions for them. One may argue that members of a virtual team cannot meet in person. The question does not provide any limitations or constraints prohibiting the 
team from getting together for a team-building activity. Bringing virtual team members for a meeting once in a while is an acceptable project management practice, making this choice a plausible 
answer.

Question 155 
Hint: It's a sprint review meeting. It is neither a planning meeting nor a retrospective.
Correct Answer: D
Explanation:
Stakeholder engagement is critical to the success of any project. On agile projects, changes are typically driven by stakeholder needs. When new stakeholders are identified during an ongoing 
project, the stakeholders should be engaged as soon as possible. One of the earliest opportunities for that engagement is at the sprint review meeting. At the sprint review meetings, the team 
presents the product increment that they have built during the sprint. According to Rawsthome and Shimp, the sprint review is conducted for three main reasons:
1. To prove to the stakeholders that the team is moving in the right direction;
2. To get feedback from the stakeholders about the work completed; and 3. To discuss the work of the next sprint with the stakeholders.
One may argue that work to be completed during the next sprint is discussed at the sprint planning meeting, not sprint review. While it's generally true, at the sprint review, the discussion of the 
work to be performed for the next sprint is done at a high-level only and does not replace the sprint planning meeting. It is at the sprint planning meeting that the sprint goal is defined after the 
team forecasts what they can deliver on that sprint. Of the choices provided, only discussing what is to be worked on in the next sprint is the most plausible answer to the question asked.
Details for Each Option:
A To reflect on the team performance
Incorrect. Team performance is discussed at the sprint retrospective meeting, not the sprint review meeting described in the scenario. Typically, stakeholders do not attend sprint retrospective 
meetings.
B To prioritize high-risk user stories for the next sprint
Incorrect. The prioritization of user stories, regardless of whether they are high-risk or not, for the next sprint typically happens at the sprint planning meeting. The scenario, however, describes 
the sprint review meeting.
C To reprioritize the release backlog
Incorrect. An agile release encompasses several sprints. The release backlog is comprised of the items to be developed during those sprints. Each sprint has its own sprint planning meeting. The 
release backlog is prioritized during the release planning meeting, not the sprint planning meeting, and not the sprint review meeting described in the scenario. 
D To discuss the high-level plans for the next sprint
Correct. Among other items, the work to be done during the next sprint is discussed at the sprint review meeting. The discussion is conducted at a high-level and does not replace the one held at 
the spring planning meeting.

Question 156 
Hint: The question references key skills included in this technique which can assist project managers in resolving issues promptly and obtaining needed resources. 
Correct Answer: A
Explanation:
Influencing skills is a component of interpersonal and team skils which is a tool and technique used in the Manage Team process. Influencing skills are often critical to the success of a project in a 
matrix environment because of the limited authority project managers have in those environments. Influencing skills can help the project manager obtain resources and solve issues promptly. 
Vital influencing skills include an ability to be persuasive, clearly articulating points and positions, high levels of active and effective listening, awareness of, and consideration for, the various 
perspectives in any situation, and gathering relevant information to address issues and reach agreements while maintaining mutual trust.
The PMBOK Guide groups many process tools and techniques, like influencing skills, based on their purpose. Useful information and tables that categorize these tools and techniques by group 
and tie them to their respective process can be found using the included page reference.
Details for Each Option:
A  Influencing
Correct. Influencing is one of 17 Interpersonal and team skills tools and techniques within the Manage Team process. This question demonstrates the use of many of the key influencing skills, 
including but not limited to, active and effective listening, clearly articulating points and positions, and others.
B  Team performance assessments
Incorrect. Team performance assessments are inputs to but are not tools and techniques of the Manage Team process. Additionally, in the scenario, you are not assessing the performance of 
your project team. Rather, you are working with the stakeholders to address their concerns and gain their support and cooperation.
C  Conflict management
Incorrect. Conflict management is a tool or technique in the Manage Team process. When conflict is appropriately managed, it can lead to Improved productivity and working relationships. 
However, this question does not indicate that there is conflict, it merely describes a meeting to address stakeholder concems.
D  Cultural awareness
Incorrect. Cultural awareness refers to understanding the differences between Individuals, groups, and organizations and adapting the project's communication strategy in the context of these 
differences. Nothing in the scenario points out cultural differences between various individuals and groups, making this choice an incorrect answer.

Question 157 
Hint: How might you use a top-down approach to estimating the team resource requirements?
Correct Answer: A 
Explanation:
The question suggests that you, as the project manager, are performing the Estimate Activity Resources process and that a hybrid development approach is being utilized. When incorporating 
agile practices within an overarching traditional waterfall approach, the project scope may be progressively elaborated throughout the project, and the work breakdown structure (WBS) may not 
be fully decomposed during initial project planning. Under such circumstances, one viable approach to estimating team resource requirements would be to utilize the analogous estimating 
technique. If there are past similar projects, the organizational process assets (OPAs) should contain detailed information that could be used for analogous estimating.
Details for Each Option:
A  Check the organizational process assets for similar projects and use analogous estimating
Correct. Analogous estimating can be used when the work breakdown structure (WBS) cannot be fully decomposed. In this case, the organizational process assets (OPAs) may contain Information 
on similar past projects that can be used as a basis for estimating team resource requirements.
B  Apply bottom-up estimating using the work breakdown structure (WBS) as a guide
Incorrect. With the bottom-up approach, team resources would be estimated at the activity level and then aggregated to develop estimates from work packages up to the project level. However, 
at this point, you are not able to fully decompose the WBS in order to identify the activities and work packages. The bottom-up estimating technique requires a fully decomposed WBS.
C  Utilize parametric estimating for the individual work packages within the existing WBS
Incorrect. The work package represents the lowest level of the work breakdown structure (WBS). In this scenario, only the highest levels of the WBS exist, which would not include the work 
package level. Therefore, in this scenario, one would not be able to apply parametric estimating to Individual work packages.
D  Decompose the WBS down to the work package level during initial project planning
Incorrect. With a traditional waterfall project, the work breakdown structure (WBS) would be fully decomposed down to the work package level during the Create WBS process. When 
Incorporating agile techniques, the project scope may be progressively elaborated as the project progresses rather than fully decomposed during Initial project planning. In this scenario, the 
question stipulates that the WBS will be progressively elaborated throughout the project rather than fully decomposed as part of initial project planning.

Question 158 
Hint: Unplanned training takes place as a result of observation, conversation, and project performance appraisals conducted during management of the project team. 
Correct Answer: B
Explanation:
The question states that a competency gap was uncovered as a result of a project team appraisal that was previously unknown. As a result, the newly discovered training need is not likely to be 
addressed in the resource management plan. If project team members lack the necessary management or technical skills, such skills can be developed as part of the project work. Scheduled 
training takes place as stated in the resource management plan. Unplanned training takes place as a result of observation, conversation, and project performance appraisals conducted during the 
management of the project team. The incorrect answer choices represent actions that do not directly address the newly discovered training need. Therefore, of the available options, conducting 
unplanned training to address the competency gap is the best response.
Note, since the unplanned training will likely consume project resources (time, budget, etc.), an approved change request will be required. While the correct answer choice does not indicate this, 
it's still the best of those provided.
Details for Each Option:
A  Implement the response planned for this risk
Incorrect. Risk responses are developed to address risks that have been identified during project planning or later as the project progresses. The competency gap is a risk. However, according to 
the scenario, the gap was previously unknown, implying no response exists for this risk.
B  Conduct unplanned training to address the competency gap
Correct. When project team members lack the necessary technical skills, these skills can be developed as part of the project work. Unplanned training takes place as a result of observation, 
conversation, and project performance appraisals conducted during management of the project team.
C  Consult the training management plan
Incorrect. 'Training management plan' is a made-up term not specified in the PMBOK® Guide.
D  Let go of the staff who have technical skill gaps
Incorrect. There is not enough information provided in the question to suggest that termination of employment is appropriate in this situation. Termination is a serious action that when initiated 
is generally the culmination of a series of progressive actions. Typically, a plan should be created and followed to fill the technical deficiencies.

Question 159 
Hint: Building trust requires demonstrating direct value to the skeptical stakeholders.
Correct Answer: A 
Explanation:
Stakeholder buy-ins are often driven by how well the project aligns with their specific needs, priorities, and strategic goals. Demonstrating alignment ensures stakeholders feel their concerns and 
objectives are valued, fostering trust and collaboration. When stakeholders see how the project directly contributes to their department's success, they are more likely to support it. For example, 
if the skeptical group's primary goal is operational efficiency, the project manager could emphasize how the deliverables will reduce redundant processes, or if their goal is market expansion, the 
project manager can explain how the project outcomes will help achieve this. By highlighting these alignments, the project manager builds credibility, showing the group that the project is not an 
isolated initiative but a critical contributor to their department's success.
The project manager should address three key concepts: Trust Building, Stakeholder Engagement, and Influence through Alignment. Trust is built when stakeholders feel their needs and goals are 
understood and prioritized. Highlighting alignment with their strategic goals demonstrates the project manager's commitment to mutual success. Effective stakeholder engagement involves 
identifying and addressing specific concerns rather than generic strategies like assigning tasks or providing updates. Aligning project goals with stakeholder priorities ensures that they see the 
project as an enabler of their success, making them more inclined to support it.
Details for Each Option:
A  Highlight the project's alignment with their department's strategic goals.
Correct. Stakeholder buy-in is often driven by how well the project aligns with their needs, priorities, and strategic goals. Demonstrating alignment ensures stakeholders feel their concerns and 
objectives are valued, fostering trust and collaboration. When stakeholders see how the project directly contributes to their department's success, they are more likely to support it. 
B  Emphasize the project's benefits to other stakeholders.
Incorrect. While highlighting the project's broader benefits might showcase its overall value, it does not address the specific concerns or priorities of the skeptical stakeholder group. This 
approach risks further allenating the group by making them feel their unique needs are being ignored.
C  Assign project tasks to this stakeholder group to increase their involvement.
Incorrect. While increasing Involvement might seem like a good strategy to build engagement, assigning tasks without addressing their skepticism could lead to frustration. They might perceive 
this as an attempt to push responsibility onto them rather than addressing their concerns.
D  Schedule additional status update meetings to keep them informed.
Incorrect. Keeping stakeholders Informed is good practice, but scheduling more meetings without tackling their specific concerns will not change their perception of the project's value. This can 
lead to meeting fatigue and further disengagement.

Question 160 
Hint: In which approach all sides win?
Correct Answer: D
Explanation:
Agile methodologies are typically used when requirements are not well-understood upfront. Thus, agile contracts need to focus on collaborative efforts and aligning the contract terms with the 
project goals. Unlike an adversarial approach of winners versus losers, which will likely result in an increased risk to the project, a collaborative approach is one that pursues a shared-risk- reward 
relationship, where all sides win. Therefore, pursuing a shared-risk-reward relationship for the outsourced portion of the work in which requirements are not well-defined upfront is the best 
course of action in this situation.
Note, the scenario describes a project in which most of the project scope is managed using the traditional/predictive project management approach (WBS) while the outsourced portion of work 
is carried out using the agile framework. This means the project as a whole is managed in a hybrid way. While this information does not change the correct answer, it is important to understand 
that projects can be managed using various approaches, including predictive (sometimes called traditional or waterfall), agile (Scrum, Kanban, etc.), or hybrid which is a combination of both.
Details for Each Option:
A  Seek an informal agreement rather than a formal contract
Incorrect. The Agile Manifesto supports the idea of customer collaboration over contract negotiation. This does not mean, however, that formal contracts are not used for agile projects (or for 
the outsourced deliverables that managed using agile methods). The contract type and terms may differ with an agile project versus waterfall, but vendor agreements should still be captured in a 
formal contract.
B  Secure a fixed-price contract for the outsourced scope
Incorrect. A fixed-price contract would be better suited to a waterfall project as opposed to agile. With waterfall projects, the scope is generaly well-understood upfront. With agile projects, the 
project scope is more likely to be progressively elaborated. As a result, it would be challenging to determine contract terms for the entire outsourced scope upfront.
C  Negotiate aggressively for the most advantageous terms
Incorrect. While it may seem natural to seek the most advantageous contract terms, this approach may not produce the best results for any project. With agile projects, the project scope is not 
typically well understand initially, which means that greater cooperation will be necessary. Thus, it will be preferable to seek contract terms that put vendor performance in alignment with the 
project goals, rather than driving the hardest bargain.
D  Pursue a shared-risk-reward contract relationships
Correct. Agile projects typically require a more collaborative approach with respect to vendors because the project scope is usually not well-defined initially and will be progressively elaborated. 
Thus contract terms that present a shared-risk-reward relationship are most advantageous for both parties.

Question 161 
Hint: What assurance is there that the situation described in the scenario will not recur?
Correct Answer: C 
Explanation:
If a business analyst is assigned to a project, requirement-related activities are the responsibility of that role. On agile projects, this role is frequently performed by a product owner. The product 
owner serves as the voice of the customer and needs to work closely with the development team to ensure that the team's efforts remain in alignment with project goals. The lack of 
involvement from a business analyst/product owner can lead to slower development and rework. Although the project manager has reached out to the business analyst and requested them to 
work with the team in the upcoming sprints, this does not mean that the issue will not recur. An effective leader should identify potential problems and address them proactively. Since the 
business analyst's lack of involvement has been identified as an issue, the project manager should continue to monitor the business analyst's involvement to ensure that the project work can 
continue without disruption.
Note, the scenario describes a project in which the project scope is managed using the traditional/predictive project management approach (e.g., work package) while the work is carried out 
using the Scrum framework (sprints). This means the project as a whole is managed in a hybrid way. While this information does not change the correct answer, it is important to understand that 
projects can be managed using various approaches, including predictive (sometimes called traditional or waterfall), agile (Scrum, Kanban, etc.), or hybrid which is a combination of both.
Details for Each Option:
A  No further action needed as the problem is resolved
Incorrect. It is unclear if the problem has been resolved. All the project manager did was reaching out to the business analyst and requesting them to collaborate with the team during the 
upcoming sprints. The problem will be considered resolved only when it's evident the business analyst is available for the team when needed.
B  Report a work ethics violation to the human resources department
Incorrect. It is not uncommon that an organization may have resource constraints resulting in some of the resources being unavailable and, consequently, unresponsive at times. An Individual 
being unavailable and/or unresponsive, though, is unlikely to be considered as one who violates work ethics.
C  Continue monitoring the business analyst's involvement
Correct. Even though it appears that the current issue has been addressed, a good proactive leader is expected to continue monitoring issues to ensure they do not reoccur going forward. 
D  Instruct the team to fix the work package to meet customer needs
Incorrect. Since the customer has not accepted the work package, it is reasonable to assume that the package will have to be modified to meet customer needs. However, before a modification 
to a work package can be made, a clarification on what exactly to fox should be provided by the business analyst, who, according to the scenario, has not been available.

Question 162
Hint: The project manager should have been proactive.
Correct Answer: A
Explanation:
The project team under the guidance of the project manager needs to be able to assess the project situation, balance the demands, and maintain proactive communications with stakeholders in 
order to deliver a successful project. In this case, a thorough assessment of the project's impact on all stakeholders early in the project life cycle may have identified the potential resistance of the 
local residents to the pathway. Identifying potential issues early allows the project team to proactively address the problems and implement strategies to resolve them to increase the prospect of 
project success.
Details for Each Option:
A  Identify the pathway as a possible point of contention with stakeholders early in the project
Correct. By identifying the problem with the pathway early, the project team could have engaged the local residents proactively and worked out a possible win-win solution for both parties. 
B  Nothing could have been done differently because the project was authorized per the project charter
Incorrect. Just because the project was authorized does not mean steps could not have been taken to avoid the situation. The conflict could have been avoided if a proper assessment of the 
project's impact on the stakeholders was conducted early in the project before the project management plan was approved so that the stakeholders' concems could have been heard and 
addressed.
C  Engage a public relations company to handle community outreach once local residents voiced their disapproval
Incorrect. This answer choice is not the best answer because engaging a public relations company after the local residents voice their disapproval is reactive and would not have 'avoided" the 
situation. The project manager and team should be proactive whenever possible in identifying potential issues and dealing with them.
D  Reroute the pathway entrance during construction to an old railway trail instead of the local street
Incorrect. Rerouting the entrance and exit points to another location may or may not resolve the local residents immediate concern and very well could lead to another conflict with the local 
community. Therefore, this choice is not the best answer to the question asked.

Question 163 
Hint: What issue might the requesting organization encounter with an agile project?
Correct Answer: C
Explanation:
Agile approaches emphasize delivering project outputs early and often. This sentiment is captured in one of the Agile Manifesto's principles. An organization that has been structured around a 
predictive project management framework (the "client" in the scenario described) may not be prepared to implement the rapid and incremental delivery that an agile approach can offer. It is not 
enough for the organization that develops the product/service ("your company" in the scenario described) to successfully deliver the project outputs. If the client is not prepared to accept the 
deliverables when they are deployable, then the return on investment will be delayed. Therefore, in this scenario, it will be important for your company to gain alignment with the client on the 
timing of the deliverables, so the full benefits of the project's output can be realized.
Details for Each Option:
A Develop a change management plan to address the inevitable changes
Incorrect. Changes are inevitable, and agile principles welcome change for the client's benefit. However, for an agile project, a change management plan would be an impediment. Agile projects 
typically collaborate with stakeholders as the product evolves rather than follow a change management plan.
B  Request the client to take part in product testing to speed up delivery
Incorrect. Clients may participate in iteration reviews where the development team demonstrates the product increment that has been developed during the iteration. Clients can also conduct 
acceptance testing. However, it is uncommon that the client participates in product testing. Product testing is the responsibility of the organization that develops the product. 
C  Gain alignment with the client on the timing of project deliverables
Correct. If the requesting organization is not prepared to accept the deliverables when they are deployable, then the return on investment will be delayed. Therefore, in this scenario, it will be 
important for the performing organization to gain alignment on the timing of the deliverables, so the full benefits of the project's output can be realized.
D  Instruct the project team to develop all features in a single release
Incorrect. Providing a full feature set in a single release would be contradictory to the early and often delivery of value. Agile projects release valuable features as soon as they are ready so the 
client can start receiving the project benefits as quickly as possible. The project team should release features as they are deployable rather than waiting for a full feature set to be delivered in a 
single release.

Question 164 
Hint: Which of the answer choices is an activity associated with the Close Project or Phase process?
Correct Answer: C 
Explanation:
The scenario suggests the project manager and team are carrying out the activities associated with the Close Project or Phase process. To convey project performance and assist in project 
evaluation, the final project report should be prepared and shared according to the communications management plan. All of the incorrect answer choices represent tasks that should be 
completed as part of process groups other than the Closing Process Group. The information provided by the question suggests that all of the tasks associated with project closure have been 
completed except for sharing the final project report.
Details for Each Option:
A  Reviewing project requirements
Incorrect. A review of project requirements would have been completed much earlier in the project as part of project planning. The question implies that the project team is performing the Close 
Project or Phase process.
B  Verifying project deliverables
Incorrect. The question states that final acceptance has been obtained which suggests that the project deliverables have already been verified, otherwise they would not have been accepted. 
Additionally, the question implies that the Close Project or Phase process is being performed, while this answer choice represents an activity associated with the Monitoring and Controlling 
Process Group.
C  Sharing the final project report
Correct. The information provided by the question suggests that all of the tasks associated with project closure have been completed except for the preparation and communication of the final 
project report.
D  Conducting benefit analysis

Question 165 
Hint: After the needs assessment, what is still required to serve as an input to the development of the project charter?
Correct Answer: C 
Explanation:
The business case is a documented economic feasibility study used to establish the validity of the benefits of a selected component lacking sufficient definition, and that is used as a basis for the 
authorization of further project management activities. The benefits management plan is the documented explanation defining the processes for creating, maximizing, and sustaining the benefits 
provided by a project or program. The business case and benefits management plan comprise the business documents which are used as an input to create the project charter. Pre- project work 
includes developing the needs assessment, business case, and benefits management plan. The pre-project work should be completed before project initiation. The question states that the needs 
assessment has already been completed; therefore, the next step is to prepare the business case and benefits management plan.
Details for Each Option:
A Collect requirements and develop the project management plan
Incorrect. Collecting requirements and developing the project management plan are activities that take place during project planning. According to the scenario, the project has not even been 
initiated yet.
B Understand the business goals and objectives to recommend proposals
Incorrect. The needs assessment involves understanding business goals and objectives, issues, and opportunities and recommending proposals to address them. The scenario states that the 
needs assessment has already been completed. Therefore, this answer choice can be eliminated.
C Prepare the business case and benefits management plan
Correct. Pre-project work includes developing the needs assessment, business case, and benefits management plan. The pre-project work should be completed before project initiation. The 
question states that the needs assessment has already been completed; therefore, the next step is to prepare the business case and benefits management plan.
D Develop the project charter and identify the key stakeholders
Incorrect. Project initiation includes the development of a project charter and identifying the stakeholders. Before the project can be initiated, the pre-project work should be completed.

Question 166 
Hint: An effective communications management plan addresses who, what," when,' 'where,' and how' of project communications.
Correct Answer: B
Explanation:
One way to plan communication management is to identify the 5Ws (Who, What, When, Where, Why) and 1H (How) of communication:
 - Who needs the information;
 - What information needs to be communicated;
 - When should the information be communicated;
 - Where should the information be communicated;
 - Why communication of the information is essential; and
 - How the information needs to be transmitted.
The scenario states that the project manager had determined the 'who, what,' and 'when' of communicating the project information. The Where," why, and how are not mentioned. Among the 
choices provided, only 'Determine how the information will be transmitted addresses the 'how' which is one of the missing '5Ws' and '1H", and is, therefore, the best answer to the question 
asked.
Details for Each Option:
A Determine the information needs of the stakeholders
Incorrect. According to the scenario, the project manager has determined which stakeholders need what information and how often. Therefore, Kathy has already established the Information 
needs of the stakeholders.
B Determine how the information will be transmitted
Correct. The project manager has determined the stakeholder communication requirements in that she knows the who, what," and "when" of the project communications. However, she has not 
yet identified how the information will be transmitted which would be the next necessary component of the communications management plan.
C Measure the effectiveness of the communications
Incorrect. The project manager is working on the communications management plan; therefore, she is most likely in the Plan Communications Management process. Measuring the effectiveness 
of the communications is performed in the Monitor Communications process which is carried out later in the project life cycle.
D Submit a change request to update the communications management plan
Incorrect. The scenario suggests the project is still in planning implying the project management plan has yet to be approved. A change request is not required to update a component of the 
project management plan that has not yet been approved.

Question 167 
Hint: What obligation, as a steward, does the project manager have to the team members?
Correct Answer: A 
Explanation:
In this scenario, the customer has expressed their frustration with the development team's performance by referring to them as lazy and incompetent. The customer might be entitled to be 
disappointed and frustrated with the project team for failing to meet their commitment. However, it is never appropriate to be disrespectful of others. One of the project management principles 
for project leaders is to be a diligent, respectful, and caring steward. Integrity obligates project leaders to ensure that the project team members, and others, are treated with dignity and respect. 
It might be a difficult conversation, but the project manager has an ethical obligation to challenge the customer to consider their words and actions to be empathetic and respectful of others.
Details for Each Option:
A  Meet with the customer in private and challenge them to be more respectful to the team
Correct. The customer might be entitled to be disappointed and frustrated with the project team for failing to meet their commitment. However, as a steward, the project manager has an 
obligation to challenge stakeholders (customers are project stakeholders) to consider their words and actions to be empathetic and respectful of others.
B  Discuss the reasons for the failed sprint during the next daily standup meeting
Incorrect. Discussing the reasons for the failed sprint as well as determining the root cause of the issue and actions to improve performance is one of the duties of the project manager as a 
servant leader. However, the appropriate venue for this topic would be the sprint retrospective rather than the daily standup meeting.
C  Encourage the team to commit to completing fewer story points for the next sprint
Incorrect. The team might or might not have overcommitted during sprint planning. However, without first knowing the reason for the failed sprint, encouraging the team to commit to 
completing fewer story points for the next sprint would not be appropriate at this point. Finding the root cause of the performance gap would be a better choice.
D  Challenge the team to work on their days off until they cover the shortfall
Incorrect. Without knowing the reason for the shortfall, assuming that there was a lack of effort by the team is not aligned with the agile leadership practices. The project manager should first 
seek to understand the root causes of the performance gap before addressing the problem. Besides, good leaders should respect team members' work-life balance.

Question 168 
Hint: Collaboration forms the basis for joint decision-making to ensure the customer receives the intended benefits of the project.
Correct Answer: D
Explanation:
The third value of the Agile Manifesto is "Customer collaboration over contract negotiation." Customer collaboration forms the basis for the joint decision-making process. It establishes a bond 
between the customer and the development team, helping ensure the customer receives the intended benefits of the project. The question describes a situation where the vendor insists that 
product specifications are thoroughly documented in the contract even though the buyer (customer) does not have a clear picture of the requirements upfront. The vendor produces the 
deliverables according to the contract negotiated at the beginning of the project, but the product does not deliver the intended value/result. In some cases, a buyer is not a product expert and 
relies on the vendor to guide the buyer in the product design and development. This approach is an example of collaborating with the customer over rigidly adhering to specifications outlined in 
a contract.
Details for Each Option:
A  Business people and developers must work together
Incorrect. This principle may have prevented the problem outlined in the scenario from occurring. However, this answer choice represents a principle of the Agile Manifesto rather than one of its 
values.
B  Individuals and interactions over processes and tools
Incorrect. There is not enough information in the question to determine if processes and tools were valued over individuals and interactions, resulting in the buyer's dissatisfaction with the 
deliverables. Better collaboration between the parties would have had a more positive effect on the outcome of the project.
C  Pair programming over continuous integration
Incorrect. Pair programming is a technique in which two developers work side-by-side developing software code. Continuous integration is a practice in which each team member's work products 
are frequently integrated and validated with one another. Both are valuable agile techniques; however, it is unclear if applying/valuing one of them over another would have prevented the 
problem described in the scenario from occurring in the first place.
D  Customer collaboration over contract negotiations
Correct. Thoroughly negotiating contracts is typical for projects that are lead using the traditional approach. In the scenario, however, the customer does not have detailed requirements upfront 
and requests that the vendor develops the device using agile methods. Collaboration over negotiations would be more beneficial for both parties.

Question 169 
Hint: Projects are initiated by an entity external to the project.
Correct Answer: B
Explanation:
Projects are initiated by an entity external to the project, such as a sponsor, program or project management office (PMO), or a portfolio governing body chairperson or authorized 
representative. The project initiator or sponsor should be at a level that is appropriate to procure funding and commit resources to the project. Therefore, a project sponsor is external to the 
project, is of high power and high interest, and has an upward direction of influence. Of the available choices, only Todd Young possesses the characteristics of a project sponsor. Note, being 
external to the project does not necessarily mean being external to the organization. The terms 'internal" vs. "external" are relative to something. The column "Internal/External to the Project" in 
the table specifies what is being referred to by 'internal and 'external". For example, the sponsor is external to the project in that they are not a member of the immediate project team, but they 
are a stakeholder to the project and internal to the organization.
Based on section 1.6 Project Stakeholders of the Pstandards+TM in the reference provided, one may argue that a sponsor is a project-internal stakeholder. Unfortunately, Plstandards+ does not 
do a great job clarifying that the examples in the "Internal stakeholders" and "External stakeholders" lists refer to stakeholders as they relate to the performing organization, not project. For 
example, in the list of stakeholders in section 1.6 Project Stakeholders, the sponsor, resource manager, PMO, team members, etc., could be either external or internal to the project, but they are 
internal to the performing organization. However, customers, end-users, suppliers, etc., are external to both project and performing organization. Therefore, we strongly believe that a sponsor is 
an individual who is external to the project, possesses high power and high interest, and has an upward direction of influence.
Note, Figure 2-1 Project Boundaries on in section 2. The Standard for Project Management: Initiating Process Group, places the sponsor outside the project boundaries, thus supporting the idea 
that a sponsor is an entity external to the project. Another consideration that may help support the correct answer is the understanding that one individual who is internal to the performing 
organization can serve as a project sponsor for multiple projects, keeping this individual external to each one of the projects he/she is sponsoring.
Details for Each Option:
A John Show - Incorrect. Projects are initiated by an entity external to the project such as a sponsor or project management office (P0). John Snow is identified as internal to the project; 
therefore, he cannot be the project sponsor.
B Todd Young - Correct. The project sponsor is most likely to be external, high power and high Interest, with an upward direction of Influence. Projects are initiated by an entity or person external 
to the project like a sponsor or PMO. A sponsor, by definition, has high power over the project and is most likely to be of high interest. The role of the sponsor has an upward direction of 
Influence. Of the available options, only Todd Young has all of the characteristics of a project sponsor.
C Marie Smith - Incorrect. Marie Smith is classified as low power on the project. The Initiator of a project by definition is high power as they are the one that is authorizing the project and the 
expenditure of resources. Additionally, a project sponsor has an upward direction of Influence rather than outward. Therefore, this answer choice can be eliminated.
DC Tonya Stewart - Incorrect Projects are initiated by an entity external to the project such as a sponsor or project management office (PMO). A project sponsor is, by definition, classified as high 
power. Additionally, a project sponsor has an upward direction of Influence. Therefore, none of the characteristics of Tonya Stewart match that of a project sponsor.

Question 170 
Hint: The size of your team may increase or decrease over time. You need to manage changes to it to optimize performance.
Correct Answer: C
Explanation:
The key words in this question "immediately" and "to manage the team composition". The change management plan is a subsidiary plan of the project management plan. It provides direction to 
manage the change control process and documents the roles and responsibilities of the change control board (CCB) if one is used on the project. The question describes a situation in which the 
project manager is in the Manage Team process. One of the activities of this process involves managing team changes to optimize project performance. For example, staffing changes, whether 
made by choice or by uncontrollable events, can disrupt the project team (and need to be managed). To do so, the project manager may submit a change request to either replace team members 
who leave or outsource some of the work.
Details for Each Option:
A  Write a work performance report to generate awareness of the lead architect's departure
Incorrect. Work performance reports are the physical or electronic representation of work performance Information which is intended to generate decisions, actions, or awareness. The 
Information from work performance reports and related forecasts assist in determining future team resource requirements, recognition and rewards, and updates to the resource management 
plan. While it is important to inform stakeholders of the change in team composition, it is not the immediate action a project manager should take in this situation.
B  Update the project organizational chart to reflect the team change
Incorrect. A project organizational chart is a graphic display of project team members and their reporting relationships, which is contained within the resource management plan. Since the 
resource management plan is a controlled document, it cannot be updated at will without an approved change request. While this step will need to be performed eventually, of the choices 
provided, it is not the immediate action required in this situation. Additionally, simply updating the project organizational chart would not address the need of managing the team composition as 
requested by the question.
C  Review the change management plan and submit a change request
Correct. Since a lead architect has been forced to leave due to a conflict of interest, the project manager must now deal with the matter by submitting a change request and follow the process 
outlined in the change management plan to replace the human resource. The change request may be to update the resource management plan to reflect the change in team composition, to 
request an additional architect to replace the one that left, or possibly to outsource the project work affected by the lead architect's departure. In any case, this is the best answer choice of those 
provided to manage your team composition.
D  Use float on the critical path to prevent schedule slippage due to this new risk
Incorrect. This answer choice is incorrect for several reasons. The first is that it describes using float on the critical path to protect the schedule. This is a false statement as a critical path should 
not contain any float. Second, while there is a potential risk of having only one project architect, this risk must first be analyzed, and a response planned before any change can be made to the 
schedule (e.g., adding a time contingency reserve). Finally, this answer choice does not directly answer the question of how to manage team composition. Per those reasons, this is not the best 
answer choice of those provided.

Question 171 
Hint: Discuss balancing collaboration, version control, and accessibility in a globally distributed team environment.
Correct Answer: C
Explanation:
Clearly defined document ownership ensures accountability, updating schedules reduces delays, and real-time synchronization protocols address inconsistencies across time zones. This approach 
ensures that the repository functions effectively for collaboration and supports global teams while maintaining version control and accessibility.
A global project involves multiple cross-functional teams in different time zones. The artifacts (important project documents, deliverables, and records) are stored in a centralized cloud-based 
repository for accessibility. Despite regular version control and accessibility checks, stakeholders report inconsistent updates, causing decision-making delays.
Stakeholder access and collaboration issues-Even though the repository is centralized, updates do not effectively reach stakeholders. Version integrity problems-Document changes are not 
consistently reflected, leading to outdated or conflicting information. Global team coordination - Different time zones and team structures mean updates may not always be communicated 
effectively.
The best approach to resolve document inconsistencies in a global project is structured artifact management (Answer C). Clearly defining ownership, schedules, and real-time syncing ensures 
accountability, consistency, and collaboration. While partially helpful, other options fail to address the root problem or introduce new risks.
Details for Each Option:
A Implement automated notifications for every document update to inform all stakeholders in real-time.
Incorrect. Automated notifications may overwhelm stakeholders and don't solve inconsistencies in updates or accountability.
B Introduce a decentralized repository system for each region to reduce dependency on a single repository.
Incorrect. A decentralized repository risks misalignment and complicates version control.
C Establish clearly defined document ownership, update schedules, and real-time synchronization protocols.
Correct. Defined ownership, schedules, and synchronization ensure effective artifact management in global projects.
D Transition to physical artifacts for high-priority documents to ensure reliability and accuracy.

Question 172 
Hint: Proper change management practices require evaluation before implementation.
Correct Answer: B 
Explanation:
The correct answer is B. Documenting the change request and assessing its impact ensures alignment with the project objectives, timeline, and budget. This step is critical in determining if the 
change should proceed. Skipping this analysis can lead to unintended consequences. Documenting the change request and evaluating its impact ensures that it aligns with the project's scope, 
objectives, timeline, and budget.
Change management is a structured process that prevents project risks and unintended consequences. The project manager should first record the change request, assess its potential impact on 
the project constraints (scope, time, cost, quality, risk, and resources), and follow the established change control process.
The project manager should first record the change request, assess its potential impact on the project constraints (scope, time, cost, quality, risk, and resources), and follow the established 
change control process.
Details for Each Option:
A Implement the change immediately to save time.
Incorrect: Implementing a change without evaluation could harm the project. Implementing a change immediately without evaluation can introduce risks such as delays, increased costs, or scope 
creep. Even if the change appears beneficial bypassing the formal evaluation process can lead to unintended consequences.
B Document the change request and evaluate its impact on project objectives.
Correct: Following change management practices requires documenting and analyzing the change request. Best practices dictate that all changes should be documented, analyzed, and reviewed 
before approval. This ensures alignment with the project's goals and avoids negative impacts.
C Reject the change as it might disrupt the project timeline.
Incorrect: Rejecting a change outright might overlook potential project benefits. Automatically rejecting a change request without evaluating its benefits could mean missing an opportunity to 
improve efficiency, reduce costs, or enhance project outcomes. While changes should be carefully managed, rejecting them outright is not a best practice.
D Present the change request to the sponsor without review.
Incorrect: Escalating a change without analysis might waste sponsor time. Presenting the change request to the sponsor without analysis wastes time and does not follow proper project 
governance. The project manager should first assess the impact and determine whether escalation is necessary before involving the sponsor.

Question 173 
Hint: Which of the answer choices would be key ingredients for agile ways of working?
Correct Answer: A,B,D,E 
Explanation:
The scenario implies that the first phase of the project was likely delivered using a waterfall project management approach, where the software had been developed in one lang iteration and 
deployed at the customer site. This approach, especially with software development products, often results in more defects in comparison to the iterative and incremental approach. What 
customer demands for the second phase can be achieved by incorporating agile practices, making the second phase hybrid. For many project teams who need to introduce more agility, setting up 
regular timeboxes and frequent retrospectives help organize the team's work in close collaboration with the customer. In addition to a more iterative approach, an incremental delivery using a 
backlog is another good first step towards agility in a project. According to the scenario, the team has problems with poor quality - test-driven development practices can address that.
Details for Each Option:
A  A cadence with regular timeboxes
Correct. By setting up a cadence in the form of regular timeboxes, a team can schedule Interaction with the relevant stakeholders (including the customer) regularly and iteratively. Many teams 
find a cadence helpful in demonstrating the working product increments to the customer, get feedback, and improve.
B  Regular and frequent retrospectives
Correct. Conducting regular and frequent retrospectives is one of the Agile Manifesto principles, "At regular Intervals, the team reflects on how to become more effective, then tunes and adjusts 
its behavior accordingly. This concept is also known as "continuous Improvement". Applying this principle would help the team to leam, improve, and adapt, likely resulting in Improved customer 
satisfaction.
C  Optimization at the level of each individual team member
Incorrect. The lean manufacturing concept of "optimizing the whole with a systemic view suggests that optimization is much more effective when it's done at the project level instead of the 
individual team member's level. Therefore, this answer choice is unlikely to contribute to the team's effort in addressing the customer's request.
D  Test-driven development practices
Correct. Test-driven development (TDD) focuses on writing test cases before writing software code. TDD approach helps teams design and reduce the number of potential mistakes. This approach 
also contributes to product quality. Thus, implementing TDD would likely reduce the number of defects in the software delivered to the customer.
E  Incremental delivery using a backlog
Correct. Incremental delivery using a backlog as a single source of requirements for a project is one of the first steps to introduce important and effective agile ideas into project environments. 
This practice can help the team improve its interaction with the customer and stakeholders, get feedback, and adjust as necessary.
Limiting the number of changes before the software is released
Incorrect. While it's true that limiting the number of changes may reduce the number of potential defects, this course of action would not necessarily address the customer's request, which is 
focused on seeing the team's results more regularly and without very long development intervals in-between.

Question 174
Hint: One of the principles servant leaders follow is creating an environment of functional accountability.
Correct Answer: A
Explanation:
Selecting the correct answer to this question is challenging due to the subtle wording differences between the answer choices. Based on our own experience as well as feedback from our 
customers, answer choices in the actual exam can be very similar to one another. Sometimes, a tiny nuance in the wording determines which choice is the correct answer.
To answer agile questions correctly, it is important to get into the agile mindset. This particular question deals with the concept of duties and principles of agile servant leadership. One of the 
principles that servant leaders follow is creating an environment of functional accountability. In the reference provided, the author states that servant leaders "give the team ample space to come 
up with the best ideas and build the best product." In order for the team to become self-organized and accountable for their own results, the author suggests that "If you [the project manager] 
stay at the process level and stay away from the details of the team's every decision and plan, you can achieve detachment. Your being detached invites them to attach and to own their results. 
This helps them achieve goals asked (and sometimes demanded) of them." Owning the results is one of the principles servant leaders should engrain in their teams. In this way, teams can learn 
to be accountable for outcomes.
The question is asking what the project manager do 'first'. There is not enough information in the scenario to determine that, if the issue is not resolved, the team will miss the iteration goal, or 
the project will fail. According to the scenario, the issue is minor. It is not an extreme situation where the project manager would need to step in and help the team resolve the issue or even 
resolve the issue by herself. Even though the project manager has the needed expertise, resolving the issue is not the project manager’s responsibility. Furthermore, servant leaders should let the 
team make technical decisions and own the outcomes, whether the outcome leads to success or failure. Servant leaders should remove themselves from the outcome. The author stresses that 
"If you diagnose the problem and implement a solution, you run the risk of being way off base. Worse, you have subtly undermined the team's ability to solve its own problems."
Details for Each Option:
A  Let the team resolve the issue
Correct. Applying agile servant leadership principles to this situation, the first thing the project manager should do is letting the team members try to resolve the issue on their own so that the 
team can own the decision and be accountable for the outcome.
B  Help the team resolve the issue
Incorrect. According to the scenario, the issue is minor. Therefore, letting the team resolve the issue would be a better approach. If the team doesn't succeed, the project manager should help. 
However, the project manager should not do the technical work for the team. Rather, the project manager may help in providing expertise or getting necessary development tools, etc.
C  Resolve the issue for the team
Incorrect. Even though the project manager has the expertise to resolve the issue, resolving the issue for the team would not be the first step for the project manager to take, nor is this the 
responsibility of a project manager regardless of what previous experience she may have.
D  Consult with the product owner
Incorrect. In general, a product owner should leave technical decisions up to the team to resolve and, in many cases, would not have much to offer in terms of technical expertise.

Question 175 
Hint: Pre-assignment is when physical or team resources for a project are determined in advance, often as part of a competitive proposal or if the project is dependent upon the expertise of 
particular persons.
Correct Answer: B 
Explanation:
Pre-assignment is a formally defined tool of the Acquire Resources process. It involves identifying physical or team resources for a project in advance and is often used when a project is 
dependent upon the expertise of particular persons. In this scenario, senior management has requested a particular individual for the project team because of their necessary expertise. 
Therefore, the project manager should accept the request. Although denying the request until the project manager has had a chance to verify the skills of a pre-assigned resource may seem like 
the best answer of those provided, it is not. The project manager can make that assessment if necessary without denying the pre-assignment request and it shouldn't be assumed the project 
manager has the expertise to verify the resources expertise.
Details for Each Option:
A  Deny the request because the project manager should be the one to acquire project resources.
Incorrect. Pre-assignment may occur as part of the Acquire Resources process, even before the project management plan has been completed. Assigning resources to a project is not necessarily 
the sole responsibility of the project manager.
B  Accept the request, since identifying specific resources for the project can occur as part of the early planning process.
Correct. This scenario describes pre-assignment, which is the act of determining physical or team resources for a project in advance. This can occur during the Develop Project Charter process or 
other processes before the initial resource management plan has been completed.
C  Accept the request only after you have finished creating the project management plan.
Incorrect. Pre-assignment is a technique that can be used during the initial stages of a project to identify specific resources, before the project management plan or project charter has been 
completed.
D  Deny the request since you have not had an opportunity to verify that the individual has the proper skills.
Incorrect. Though there is merit to questioning whether or not a resource has the proper skills, there is nothing stated in the question that implies this would be necessary. There will be times 
when the project manager will need to defer to the expertise of others, such as senior management, SMEs, etc.

PM Approach: Predictive

Question 176 
Hint: Consider the financial constraints, contractor coordination, and phased approach.
Correct Answer: B
Explanation:
The correct answer is B) Predictive execution with phased contracting. Predictive strategies provide clear plans and control, while phased contracting addresses financial constraints and 
coordination requirements.
A government-funded infrastructure project with financial constraints, multiple contractors, and a phased rollout requires an execution strategy that ensures control, predictability, and structured 
coordination. Given these constraints, the predictive execution with phased contracting is the most suitable approach because:
Predictive methodologies (often called waterfall) are ideal for projects with fixed budgets and well-defined scopes.
Phased contracting allows for structured financial management, ensuring that funding is allocated efficiently while managing risks in stages.
Government projects typically require strict compliance, accountability, and detailed upfront planning, elements well-supported by a predictive approach.
Multiple contractors are easier to manage when contracts are clearly defined in advance rather than using iterative or adaptive approaches that may introduce variability.
Details for Each Option:
A  Agile execution with frequent iterations
Incorrect. Agile is not ideal for fixed-budget, contractor-heavy projects. Agile is not well-suited for govemment-funded infrastructure projects with rigid budget constraints and requiring extensive 
contractor coordination. Agile methodologies work best in projects with high uncertainty and evolving requirements, which is not true for Infrastructure projects with pre-defined specifications. 
Frequent iterations in Agile could introduce budget and scope uncertainties, making it difficult to maintain cost control.
B  Predictive execution with phased contracting
Correct. This approach aligns with fixed budgets and phased rollout requirements. Predictive execution (Waterfall) ensures a well-structured approach with detailed planning and cost control, 
which is crucial for government-funded projects. Phased contracting allows financial oversight and reduces risk exposure, ensuring compliance with funding and contract constraints. This method 
supports clear contract deliverables, procurement regulations, and risk management-all essential for large-scale infrastructure projects.
C  Incremental execution with rolling wave planning
Incorrect. While incremental planning adds flexibility, it is less sulted to contractor-heavy projects. Rolling wave planning Introduces adaptive elements, which can benefit evolving requirements 
but may not be ideal for projects with strict contractor dependencies. Incremental execution breaks the project into functional parts, which can work well for software development but is not 
always suitable for construction and Infrastructure projects. This approach could create coordination challenges when multiple contractors need to work within a predefined framework.
D  Hybrid execution using Agile and Predictive elements
Incorrect. Hybrid approaches may overcomplicate execution without adding significant value. Because they combine Agile and Predictive elements, they may increase complexity without adding 
significant value in this case. Agile is not typically required for infrastructure projects where a predictive, phase-based approach already provides structured execution. Mixing Agile with 
Predictive may Introduce inefficiencies, as contractors and govemment funding agencies often require strict contracts and milestone-based payments rather than Iterative execution.

Question 177 
Hint: What type of employee is capable of completing more tasks on a Kanban board?
Correct Answer: C 
Explanation:
The fact the project will be initiated and planned using a predictive approach, while the development team will use Kanban (one of the agile methods), indicates that a hybrid management 
approach has been selected for the project. High performing agile teams are cross-functional as they are comprised of T-shaped people (also known as generalizing specialists). Generalizing 
specialists can perform a wider range of project tasks compared to I-shaped people (specialists). An agile team of generalizing specialists will have greater flexibility, which will help avoid 
bottlenecks and increase throughput. Transforming the development team from I-shaped to T-shaped should improve velocity. The incorrect answer choices represent actions that would provide 
little to no value or would be counterproductive.
Details for Each Option:
A  Send the development team to a seminar on maximizing WIP
Incorrect. One of the goals in Kanban is to maximize the value of a product delivered to the customer while minimizing work in progress (WIP). One of the principles of the Agile Manifesto states, 
"Working software is the primary measure of progress." Thus, WIP represents no value to the customer and should be minimized, not maximized
B  Provide training to transform T-shaped people into I-shaped people
Incorrect. T-shaped people may have a specialized skillset but are also able to perform a wide range of tasks beyond their specialty. I-shaped people have specialized skillset but are limited to 
their specialty T-shaped people offer the project team more flexibility and greater redundancy. It would not make sense to transform T-shaped Into I-shaped people. 
C  Deliver training to convert l-shaped people into T-shaped people
Correct. T-shaped people are also known as generalizing specialists. Generalizing specialists can perform a broader range of project tasks compared to -shaped people (specialists). 
D  Train the team on how to best prioritize the features to be developed
Incorrect. With agile projects, it is the product owner, not the development team, who has the responsibility for prioritizing the product backlog. Thus, training the team to better prioritize the 
features in the backlog would provide little or no benefit.

Question 178 
Hint: Agile leaders shield their project team members from distractions.
Correct Answer: B
Explanation:
Successful project leaders demonstrate leadership behaviors. When significant changes are made to the project goals, the original project charter will likely become misaligned. Under such 
circumstances, the project charter should be revised to keep the document current and relevant. However, the project charter is owned by the project sponsor rather than the project team, and 
asking the team members to revise the document would distract them from their development work. Project leaders should shield the team from distractions. In this case, the best course of 
action would be for the agile leader to take ownership of the issue and work with the sponsor to revise the project charter as necessary.
Note, typically, project charters are not revised. In rare cases, for example, when a project manager is replaced, a charter can be amended. Furthermore, if the project is no longer aligned with 
the original charter (like in the scenario described), a question should be asked as to the validity of the project altogether. Terminating the project should be considered. However, none of the 
answer choices reflect these options. Therefore, one should select the choice that, under the circumstances described in the scenario, best addresses the question asked, even if that choice does 
not look/sound like a perfect/ideal/complete answer.
Details for Each Option:
A  Ask the team member to revise the project charter and submit it to the project sponsor for approval
Incorrect. The project charter will likely need to be revised and approved by the project sponsor. However, it would not be appropriate to ask a team member to revise the charter. Team 
members should be focused on their development work rather than being pulled away to perform tasks outside their primary responsibility, which is delivering value.
B  Take ownership of the issue and work with the project sponsor to revise the project charter
Correct. One of the responsibilities of an agile leader is to shield the project team from distractions. Since the project team does not own the project charter, the agile leader should accept 
responsibility for addressing the issue with the project sponsor and keeping the team focused on their development work.
C  Capture the risk of misalignment between the project backlog and the charter in the risk register
Incorrect. The issue of misalignment between the project backlog and the charter might or might not represent a new risk. Regardless, adding it to the project risk register (if one exists on this 
agile project) is the right next step for the agile leader to take. However, merely documenting the risk would not resolve the issue as requested by the question.
D  Empower the project team members to develop and implement their own project charter
Incorrect. The project charter is owned by the project sponsor, not the team. Project team members are empowered to develop their own team charter, which establishes the team values, 
agreements, and operating guidelines for the team. However, having the team members develop and implement their own project charter makes little sense.

Question 179 
Hint: What output of the Define Scope process is missing?
Correct Answer: A
Explanation:
In the scenario described, the project team has completed the requirements management plan, which is an output of the Plan Scope Management process. Additionally, the team has completed 
the requirements documentation and requirements traceability matrix, which are outputs of the Collect Requirements process. The next step in the Planning Process Group is the Define Scope 
process and the creation of the project scope statement. Before creating the WBS, the project scope must be well defined and documented in the project scope statement. The completed 
project scope statement sets the boundaries for the project by defining the work that is included in the project as well as the work excluded from the project. The project scope statement serves 
as a guide when creating the WBS and should be completed before work begins on the WBS. The project team wants to move on to creating the WBS, but they have forgotten that they need to 
create the project scope statement before the WBS can be created.
Details for Each Option:
A Create the project scope statement
Correct. According to the scenario, the project team is in the Planning Process Group of the Project Scope Management Knowledge Area. The requirements documentation and the requirements 
traceability matrix are both outputs of the Collect Requirements process; therefore, the team has completed the Collect Requirements process. The next step in the Planning Process Group 
would be the Define Scope process. The project scope statement is an output of the Define Scope process and should be completed before proceeding to the Create WBS process.
B Complete the project management plan
Incorrect. In the scenario described, the team has completed the requirements management plan which is an output of the Plan Scope Management process. The requirements management 
plan is one of the components of the project management plan. Therefore, it is not possible to complete the project management plan before creating the requirements management plan.
C Update the lessons learned register
Incorrect. The lessons learned register is a project document that captures knowledge gained in the project. The project team is supposed to benefit from this knowledge to Improve further 
project performance. There is not enough information in the question to determine what beneficial knowledge has been gained during the development of the project artifacts described in the 
scenario.
Incorrect. The scenario states the project is still in the planning stage; therefore, in the Planning Process Group. The Validate Scope process is part of the Monitoring and Controlling Process 
Group. The project planning must be completed, and execution underway before the project would be in the Monitoring and Controlling Process Group. Therefore, performing the Validate Scope 
process is not what the team forgot.

Question 180 
Hint: What role serves as the voice of the customer?
Correct Answer: C 
Explanation:
When using a scrum framework, the product owner works directly with the stakeholders to determine project requirements and incorporate stakeholder feedback in the development of the 
items in the product backlog. The product owner serves as the voice of the customer by representing the relevant stakeholders and providing direction to the project team. Since the product 
owner is responsible for working with the stakeholders to determine product requirements, it would make the most sense to have the product owner analyze and categorize the stakeholders' 
influence. A power and influence grid can assist the product owner in a grouping of stakeholders according to their level of authority (power) and ability to influence the outcomes of the project 
(influence).
Details for Each Option:
A  Submit a change request to update the stakeholder register
Incorrect. According to the scenario, the project is in planning. During planning, change requests are not required to update any of the components of the project management plan or project 
documents. In general, unless stated otherwise in the scenario, change requests are not required to update project documents, such as the stakeholder register.
B  Wait until the stakeholders attend the first sprint review
Incorrect. Understanding the stakeholders' level of influence and engaging with them as soon as possible in the project would allow the project manager to set and better manage their 
expectations. Waiting with this activity until the first sprint review would increase the risk of the stakeholders being unsatisfied and the product increment being rejected.
C  Suggest that the product owner use a power/influence grid
Correct. On projects where the product is developed using Scrum, the product owner is responsible for working with the stakeholders to determine product requirements. Therefore, it would 
make the most sense to have the product owner analyze and categorize the stakeholders' influence.
D  Conduct the analysis yourself using hierarchical charts
Incorrect. Hierarchical charts are an example of the data representation techniques that can be used for various purposes as part of the Plan Resource Management process or Perform 
Qualitative Risk Analysis process. Those charts, however, are not used during the Plan Stakeholder Engagement process implied by the scenario.
